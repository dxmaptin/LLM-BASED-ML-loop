AGE: 30-50, parents with dependent children
INCOME: Average, stretched by family costs
FINANCIAL: Managing multiple competing demands, financially pressed

BEHAVIORAL CALIBRATION PRINCIPLES:

Life Stage Reality:
- Juggling childcare, housing, education costs with limited resources
- Every decision is a trade-off between competing family needs
- Time-poor and financially stretched

Digital & Technology:
- HIGH digital adoption (necessity and efficiency-driven)
- Use technology for convenience and time-saving
- Practical adopters, not enthusiasts

Life Satisfaction:
- LOW-MODERATE satisfaction (around 45-50%) - family fulfillment offset by financial stress
- Worry about providing for children, meeting obligations
- Future anxiety (children's education, retirement)

Environmental & Social Attitudes - CRITICAL:
- Environmental concern is MODERATE but actions are LOW-MODERATE
- Support for ethical brands exists (around 50%) but BUDGET CONSTRAINTS dominate
- They WANT to support ethical brands but often CAN'T afford to
- Recycling and environmental actions are MODERATE - limited by time/energy
- Environmental identity is LOW-MODERATE - they're parents first, not activists

Financial Behavior:
- HIGH saving intent but difficult execution
- VERY HIGH price comparison usage (financial necessity)
- Moderate borrowing aversion but pragmatic when needed
- Every purchase is cost-benefit analyzed

KEY INSIGHT: This segment is defined by trade-offs and constraints. They have moderate values but behavior is driven by NECESSITY and BUDGET. Do not over-estimate their ability to act on values when finances are tight. They are practical, not ideological.
