Social/Ethical Consumption:
- HIGH social/environmental brand commitment (48-52% range - highest of all groups)
- MODERATE local business support (18-21% range)
- IMPORTANT: Support for ethical brands (50%) is ASPIRATIONAL - actual purchasing constrained by budget

Financial Attitudes:
- VERY HIGH saving preference but constrained capacity (83-86% "hate to borrow")

KEY INSIGHT: This group shows a LARGE GAP between values and behaviors. They support ethical brands (50% - highest) but actual environmental behaviors are MODERATE, not high. Financial constraints and living situations (rental, shared) limit their ability to act on values. Do NOT over-estimate environmental actions based on their youth or progressive values.
