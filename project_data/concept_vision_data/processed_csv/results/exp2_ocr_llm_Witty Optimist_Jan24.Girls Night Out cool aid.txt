I understand that you'd like assistance with cleaning and organizing the OCR text from a product concept image. However, it seems there was an error in extracting the actual text you intended to analyze, as the content provided is not related to product information. To help you effectively, I would need the actual raw OCR text that includes details about the product.

If you can provide the extracted text, I can follow these steps to organize the information:

1. **Product Name and Brand**:
   - Identify the name of the product and the brand associated with it.

2. **Product Description**:
   - Provide a concise description of the product's purpose and functionality.

3. **Product Category**:
   - Determine the category or type of product (e.g., skincare, electronics, food).

4. **Key Claims and Benefits**:
   - Highlight any advertised benefits or unique selling points of the product.

5. **Ingredients or Formulation Details**:
   - List the main ingredients or components if relevant, paying attention to any potential errors.

6. **Packaging Format and Specifications**:
   - Describe how the product is packaged and any relevant specifications (e.g., dimensions, material).

7. **Usage Instructions**:
   - Outline how the product should be used according to the text.

8. **Price and Size Information**:
   - Include any details about pricing and the size or quantity of the product.

9. **Taglines or Marketing Messages**:
   - Note any memorable phrases intended for marketing or branding purposes.

10. **Identify Any Missing or Unclear Information**:
    - Highlight any areas where key information is missing or unclear.

Please provide the actual text or any additional details if available.
