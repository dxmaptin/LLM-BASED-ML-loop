• Nothing to dislike
• Only the formatting of the ad, there is a lot of information in small font
• It’s nothing new lots of other companies have been making products like this for years
• It's a scrub I don't like the little bits in it
• I don’t like that is not natural
• It’s just a body scrub
• it still feels a bit generic
• Its not that unique
• The images look false and not true of the soap and glory brand.
• There are already loads of scrubs available, it doesnt sound very different
• Some people might have more than one skin issue so would meed to buy 2 seperate products
• Nothing
• Notting
• Thé fragrances
• Bolder letters
• It just seems to be another average body scrub.
• Nothing
• May take a while to work
• Nothin i didnt like
• Nothing about scents
• I feel like sativa oil was used just to interest people who wouldnt otherwise care. Im skeptikal of actual benefits.
• There's a tub marked Rituals and not Soap and Glory
• nothing
• The pictures are generic and inconsistent
• Really the only thing I did not like is the attachment itself. It did not look that professional in my opinion.
• Too much going on
• nothing i like it
• Looks to be pricey if I had to guess.
