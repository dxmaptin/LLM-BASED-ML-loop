• im not a moisturiser girlie so wont be buying
• No thing
• Nothing
• Nothing in particular
• Price
• does it really look like the pic in real life
• There is nothing I didn't like
• It looks like a big lip balm that greases you all over.
• It's a stick
• The price
• not sure
• I disliked everything about the product
• there are a lot of similar products
• I didn't like anything
• I probably wouldn’t use it very often.
• I think it's not a good value for money
• Thank goodness it's at a very good price point, otherwise, i wouldn't buy it (shea butter and castor oil are not unique ingredients).
• The prices high, and unless the roll-on last for a few months.
• The cartoons were a bit misleading
• This just doesnt fit my lifestyle right now. Im a toddler mom who breastfeeds and works full time. This would have been exciting when i was in my 20s and going out to clubs and dating
• I don’t feel it’s necessary to “shine” like that
• Its likened to lip balm and would seem to be a sticky coating that would block the pores. It's too shiny and the scent might mingle well with perfumes one might wear. It says it has shea butter, but it's so shiny I'm sure there's very little in it. In fact I'm willing to be there's more caster oil, the cheaper ingredient, than shea butter. Lastly, and certainly not least, the price is way too high for this small stick of mostly caster oil and goodness knows what other fillers, thickeners, binders and artificial scent.
• I don’t think this product is that useful.
