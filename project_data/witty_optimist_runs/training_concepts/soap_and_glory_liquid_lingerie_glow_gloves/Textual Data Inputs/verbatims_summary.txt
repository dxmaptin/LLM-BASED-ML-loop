• I really like the 2 main ingredients (vitamin e and peptides). I also like the application container and fragrance ingredients.
• I like that it's not only hand cream but also a shimmer and fragrance for your hands & wrists.
• I genuinely like the applicator, and the overall idea of a sparkling lotion that reduces fine lines as a woman who is approaching 37 and always been told how young I look, so want to maintain that.
• I like the whole concept but I especially like the vitamin E added and the scent, I can imagine it’s just right for relaxing.

• looks expensive and a bit of a lie
• No thing
• Nothing
• Nothing in particular
• Just a hand cream, the price
• looks greasy
• It’s a strange concept to have glittery, shimmery hands
• Maybe the tanning part, as will need to try. Is suitable for all skins?
• There is nothing that i didn't like
• I don't like the picture of the sparkly gloves.
• It is a really odd product and I am not sure anyone would like it
• The gloves part is a bit confusing, made me think we wear gloves before I saw the images
• Glitter
• It's something I wouldn't use
• possible greasy feel
• The name makes you think it would be some sort of glove you put on and leave on for a period of time and allow it to soak in.
• I dislike everything
• i am Black so I did not connect when it said it can blend in a fake tan
• The first picture is scary and make me itch
• Glitter hands is ridiculous
• it is traditional
• The first picture of glitter hands, I can see someone being mad that’s not the result they are going to get
• I feel like it would make my hands greasy
• No ingredients listed
• I think I've seen the idea in another product/brand
• I think the price could be better or enlarge the container.
• I think it should also come in lavender or something similar in an essential oil type fragrance.
• I didn’t see a price clearly listed
• I dont need it
• I wouldn’t want shimmer on my hands
• I don't like that it suggest that the product shimmers. But on another picture of a hand ( I assume the product has been applied to the hand) doesn't look to shimmer as much as the first one. It be nice if the pictures were labeled so we know if they are before or after. The product could possibly rub off on furniture. This would cause you to ruin your own or other peoples and cause embarrassment.
• I don’t think the applicator looks very efficient.
