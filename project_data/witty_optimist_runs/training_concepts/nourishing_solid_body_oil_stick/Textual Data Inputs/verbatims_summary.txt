--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Nothing i disliked about this idea
• It’s unclear how effective a moisturising ‘stick’ would be
• Nothing
• Prob quite small and need to be replaced more often
• It doesn't seem like it'll help the skin. It seems purely cosmetic
• This description does not mention whether it is vegan so makes me wonder if it as sustainable as it claims.
• THERE ARE NO INGREDIENTS
• I’m not sure I would really need it
• i would love to know the price actually
• Nothing at all
• It's basiclalt bio oil in a stick format, not an everyday product i would use
• Irritating, expensive.
• i dont want a stick, I prefer lotion
• As an older lady with no children I find the pregnancy advertising off putting and the marketing of it is irrelevant to me
• Concerned it would make my skin oily
• No
• It looks not useful to my life currently and there is too much text
• Nothing
• Results uncertain
• the whole idea of sitting in this mess turns me off
• Part of the experience is lotion is the soft hands from the rubbing
• None of the claims are verifiable
• I don’t like the stick concept
• Coconut scent
• nothing
• Seems cheap
• Seems to be aimed at pregnancy
• It seems like several other products
• Cost probably would be an issue.
• it looks nice
