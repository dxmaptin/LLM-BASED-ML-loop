• Too much written info
• Don’t like the idea of spraying scents on my face
• I am not sure about the final effect.
• Dont like the 'marking your territory' phrase. Makes it sound like wee!
• Only thing is that it doesn't feel that unique - most perfumes would smell difference on everyone as it reacts to natural body oil etc.
• I'm not convinced it will work as described
• Nothing at the moment
• Telling the consumer that it can be used "anywhere" on your body. There are certain intimate parts that do not need shower products at all, so could be misleading.
• Not a product I would buy
• Not sure if i would like the scent
• Just don't use that hrand
