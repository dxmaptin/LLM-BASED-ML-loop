• Too much to read
• I dislike how it talks about probiotic
• Lots of information
• Nothing
• menthol can feel a bit stingy on the skin
• To much to read and see
• I don't really understand why it claims to be supporting individual needs when there are only 4 products.
• Nothing at the moment
• nothing
• Unnecessary
• just a little price high
