• Too much to read
• Just not interested
• Nothing
• Prefer established sun creams
• I use mineral sunscreens rather then chemical ones and this product does not state that it is the former.
• that there is no SPF50 option or a face option
• Price?
• I'm not convinced it will be as effective as other products. Sun protection should be first priority, not how nice it smells
• It sounds like it smells god
• The brand
• Too cluttered
