• No thing
• Nice
• Nothing in particular
• The price
• there plenty of other products like thuson the market
• There is nothing I didn't like
• Nothing to dislike about this idea.
• Nothing
• Feel like it might be sticky to touch. Can't apply whilst out and about as have to wait 30seconds to dry.
• staining clothes
• Nothing
• I dislike everything
• There’s just so many skin tones. I’m not sure how it would be possible to blend with all of them
• Putting it all over your body
• I really like it very much
• I'm not thrilled that mica is the main ingredient.
• I feel like the price is high, unless it last for like several months with daily use
• I don’t like that there isn’t a more detailed ingredient list for the sheen capsules
• I did not like the second image
• I dont meed to hide anything i just want a simple moisturizer like eucerin or aquaphor
• The price is way to high for 4 oz of gel goop. Gel like products tend to get tacky and leave small lumps. The picture of the legs looks doctored, so I assume the product isn't as great as it's said to be. I also don't fancy taking the time to roll a product all over my body. I just don't need to shimmer like that.
• Just to let you
• The applicator and the overall description. I don’t completely understand how it is supposed to “blur” my skin.
• Likely
