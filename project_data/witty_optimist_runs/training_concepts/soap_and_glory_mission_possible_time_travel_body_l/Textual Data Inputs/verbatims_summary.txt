• I do not believe the four week turnaround.
• Nothing
• Described as magical is that too optimistic
• Make packaging sustainable
• quite pricy, small bottle
• How to describe the product...
• Dont tryst that tube
• i do not like the 3 pictures
• Price
• Seems very easy to use
• Gimmicky and not sure it’s something people  would use long term.
• Image picture
• Same as most moisturiser’s
• Price for amount of product
• The assumption it will work
• I don’t love the packaging. It’s ok, but I often look for lotions in bottles that I can squeeze and cut the end off to open and scoop the very last bits of product out.
• How soon it would run out
• That this product probably works after many months and not immediately
• I dont see anything i dont like about the product.
• The amount of product for a travel size is a bit high, compared to other brands using similar ingredients.
• The wording and description
• The wording on the product and in the product description. “Pre damaged” and “it never happened” can be a big turn off to individuals who experience trauma and it is estimated 1of 4 girls are sexually abused, that’s a big chunk of the target audience with this product
• Packaging info irrelevant
• Not much images
• Wish it was bigger quantity for the price
• The color of the image looks just ok
• Hit or Miss if I will get effective results
• I use lots of body lotion and portion of the packaging looks like it go through the product within a day.
• Had to get rid of
• Price
• Takes four weeks
