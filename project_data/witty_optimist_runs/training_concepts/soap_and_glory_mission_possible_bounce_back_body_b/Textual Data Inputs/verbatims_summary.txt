• You cannot get rid of cellulite with a cream in any way shape or form.
• nothing
• Just like bio pil
• It may be a bit misleading thinking using it would get rid of cellulite
• I like eco friendly packaging so would want the ball shape to be recyclable and made of sustainable resources
• would be nice to have a big jar for a better value for money
• there is nothing i dislike
• Nothing
• Somewhat unbelievable
• A little gimmicky and not sure people need it
• Picture
• does it do exactly what it says. Tried similar products in past that didnt work
• I dislike the price
• Slightly overpriced
• There seem to be a ton of stretch mark products and I can’t seem to pinpoint one thing about this product that makes it stand out from others based on ingredients.
• The way it doesn’t show the actual
Product
• I am not sure of the size of the product, though it may be in the ad. I’d like to know what the product bottle looks like.
• I've seen products like this already on the market, nothing new. There is also therapy procedures at med spas that cost a bit more but are more affective.
• The wording
• Not sure if it would work much like similar programs
• “Bounce Back” doesn’t celebrate natural bodies. Even fit and healthy individuals have cellulite, so it feels a bit like if you have the natural occurrence of cellulite there is something wrong and you have to “bounce back”
• The colors of font
• The images
• Hit or miss results
• the price
• Had to get rid of
• Everything else
• Remind me I’m fat
