• The word probiotic
• Label isn’t that eye catching
• Nothing
• Would answer after use
• Dislike the add
• Not sure how much I believe probiotics can survive in the products to make a difference to the skin, and whether applying topically will actually do anything. Seems to be playing on the trend of 'mental health awareness' like most brands now.
• I feel there is too much writing. Less is more. You can have all the information in fewer words. It makes me not want to be bothered to read all this
• The brand
