• Not for my age group
• I am conscious if too many chemicals are used
• The first photo
• Worry it could be greasy on my skin and cause blemishes
• Flavour and glitter
• Price
• The writing is too small
• I'm not sure I would pay £10 unless there was enough to last a while
• I would need to buy before I feel it has worked on the skin and the ingredients its used.
• Didnt say how difficult it is to wash off at the end of the day or night
• not for us old farts
• The glitter
• I don’t know how much glitter it has?
• Messy
• Don't like glitter
• I dislike that the product doesn’t protect you from the sun
• Once again more scented products! I cannot use anything with scents or fragrance. Please stop with all the fragrance!
• glitter
• Lack of diversity in the pictures/models. Lack of color range/ doesn’t say if it will be a line of diff colors or one color fits all. Will it blend in darker skin?
• I M nervous about glitter- it gets everywhere and can be hard to get off.  It feels too young for me to use consistently
• It's very interesting
• Hard to take off
• price point, this is a product that will onlybe used once or twice  a year
• Pricey
• Nothing
• The only one that has to
