However, without a price point or scientific backing, the perceived value is moderate. The appeal and excitement suggest a decent perceived benefit, but without premium benefits or pricing information, the value perception remains in the middle range.",
        "believability_logic": "The product lacks scientific backing and proof points, which typically lowers believability. However, the emotional and sensory claims, such as the refreshing scent and convenience, are more believable. The consumer feedback shows excitement and interest, which supports moderate believability.",

However, the relevance score is moderate (60%), and the price/value perception is also moderate (60%). These factors suggest a moderate purchase intent. The believability score is 50%, which is not low enough to significantly suppress intent but indicates some skepticism. The positive verbatim feedback highlights the product's convenience and innovative nature, supporting a decent purchase intent.",
        "trial_logic": "Trial intent is slightly lower than purchase intent due to potential barriers such as price and availability, which are common concerns for new products. However, the convenience and excitement around the product suggest that trial intent will closely follow purchase intent.",

Incremental trial is set at 35%, reflecting the product's new and unique nature, which is likely to attract new customers. The star rating of 72 aligns with the high appeal and excitement scores, adjusted slightly down due to moderate relevance and price/value perceptions."
