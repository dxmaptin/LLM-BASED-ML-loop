• Nothing
• Need to know how this is different to a bar of soap
• All
• I don't think it looks very appealing to use and looks like the texture would be rough and unpleasant.
• THERE IS TOO MUCH WRITING. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SMALLER BLURBS TO GIVE IMPORTANT INFORMATION AS OPPOSED TO TOO MUCH WRITING
• Nothing comes to mind.
• i would love to know the price of this product.
• Looks cheap and tacky
• I dont like bars, theyre unhygienic
• Nothing at all
• ergonomically - would most people know what this means?
• don't like bath bombs
• nothing
• Bath bomb
• Messy
• No
• A little too much text
• I prefer liquid
• Sorry, i thought the last round of questions was for the bar. I think the sativa oil is  likely unnecessary and likely included just to create buzz
• Chunky
• It’s a soap bar
• Again, the right side is so busy and has too much going on.
• Images are inconsistent and generic
• I don't usually use soap bars so I probably would not use this
• I don’t like the bumps sticking out, they look like it might hurt when you wash with it.
• I do not like soap bars in general, mainly because of the mess and the way they make my skin feel.
• Too much going on with the description
• Nothing
• I don’t like bar soap
• I wish it addressed potentially helping KP
• Too much writing
