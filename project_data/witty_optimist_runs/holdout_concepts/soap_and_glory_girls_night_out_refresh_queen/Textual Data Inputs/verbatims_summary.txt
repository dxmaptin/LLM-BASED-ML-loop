• The packing picture
• Masy be greasy
• The price and it be concerned wouldn't be suitable for wiping the face, especially with make up on.
• Price
• Cleaning wipes are not good for the skin.
• Nothing
• Im not sure its a product I would use enough to become a regular buy
• I feel it contains too many artificial ingredients and it will effect the natural moisturise of the skin making it feel unreal and fake, its looks like its too much glitter not an everyday use the product.
• I feel like the price is too high and not enough packages. What will happen is the person just won’t buy the product if there is to little in the box
• Basic
• It's not very sustainable
• That it is glittery
• I'm not sharing. And the scent.
• I dislike the picture they used of the packaging. They should have used a picture of the washcloth
• I cannot use scented products so I cant use this unless there is a completely unscented fragrance free version
• way to expensive
• The package should have a label
• It's very good
• doesnt say how it will keep you fresh. If its not deodorized its just going to be funk and perfume mixed together
• Never try it
• Will it smell like cucumber?
• Probably the fragrance, I would like more options
• Nothing
• Day you had a great day today
