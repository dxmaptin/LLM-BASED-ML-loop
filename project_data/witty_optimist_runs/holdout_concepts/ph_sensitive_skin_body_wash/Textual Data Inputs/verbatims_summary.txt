• Nothing
• I don’t care for brands jumping on the mindful and vegan bandwagon
• i hope the bergamot is not too strong
• IT DOES NOT STAND OUT IN COMPARISON TO OTHER PRODUCTS
• The images are again, not usual of the brand and look like they have been taken from a spa website.
• Aloe vera
• i don't find this product different from other.
• I’m not sure how different it is compared to other things on the market which would make me question purchasing it
• A bit boring
• I'm not a fan of rose fragrance. I wish it came in other scents
• No price
• more fragrance options
• dermatologist approved. who / which dermatologist?
• I do not like the brand
• Way too cluttered and doesnt catch my interest
• Not tested on animals just picky humans!
• It is fruity
• Doesn’t show the product itself
• Bar of soap. Doubt wont be harsh to skin
• Again, I don’t like how busy the right side is
• The ad itself
• I don't like sticks.
• Nothing
• Portrays like a healthy product but sometimes that is not true.
• The cost probably would be a problem.
• i dont know
