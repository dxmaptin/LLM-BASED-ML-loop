### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.70
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run correctly identifies that the available quantitative evidence (country of birth and account management by phone) is not directly relevant to attitudinal agreement, and the values are low, indicating no strong demographic signal. The qualitative notes are not informative for the specific attitude concept. Therefore, applying the V4 baseline for attitudes is methodologically sound. No concept-specific correction or demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence provided. Confidence is appropriately rated as moderate to moderate-high due to the lack of direct attitudinal data but strong template fit. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline template is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction or strong demographic calibration indicated by the provided quantitative evidence (all values are low and not directly related to attitudinal agreement). No anchor distribution is provided. The evidence is mostly neutral and does not suggest deviation from the general baseline. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct attitudinal data.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated, and the provided quantitative evidence is not directly related to the target concept (it covers country of birth and account management channels, not attitudes). No demographic calibration is warranted as the evidence does not indicate a strong deviation from the general population. The qualitative notes are not informative for this concept. Therefore, the general V4 attitude baseline is used. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. No concept-specific correction is indicated, and there is no strong demographic signal in the quantitative evidence (all values are low, <0.12, and relate to country of birth or banking by phone, which do not suggest a need to adjust the baseline). There is no qualitative evidence that would shift the distribution. Therefore, the general V4 attitude template is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated, and the quantitative evidence provided is not directly related to the attitude concept (it focuses on account management and country of birth, with low prevalence values). No strong demographic calibration is warranted, as the evidence does not indicate a significant deviation from the general population. Therefore, the general V4 attitude baseline is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated in the V4 prompt for a generic 'Concept' item, and the provided quantitative evidence is not directly relevant to the attitude in question (values are low and pertain to country of birth and account management by phone, not to a specific attitude). No demographic calibration is applied, as the evidence does not indicate a strong deviation from the general population. Confidence is moderate-high due to the use of the V4 baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.87
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run is clearly grounded in the direct quantitative evidence: only 7% of the segment self-identify as environmentalists and just 26% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating low environmental engagement. The use of the V4 baseline (which already corrects for systematic over-prediction in previous versions) is appropriate, and the decision to further reduce agreement in some runs is well-supported by the segment's low pro-environmental attitudes. There is no evidence suggesting this segment should be calibrated upwards. The confidence is high due to strong alignment between the quantitative evidence and the predicted toplines, and the approach is consistent across runs. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 7.40%
  Slightly agree: 20.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.80%
  Slightly disagree: 24.00%
  Strongly disagree: 17.60%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3 and cross-class correction. Segment quantitative evidence shows very low self-identification as environmentalist (7%) and low trust in energy companies' environmental care (26%), both indicating below-average environmental concern for this group. No evidence suggests this segment is more pro-environment than the general population, so no upward demographic calibration is warranted. The V4 corrected baseline is therefore appropriate, and the evidence supports the lower end of agreement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class consistency.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), due to systematic over-prediction in V3 and high cross-class consistency of low agreement. The quantitative evidence for this segment shows only 7% consider themselves environmentalists and 26% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating low environmental engagement. This supports using the V4 corrected baseline without upward demographic adjustment. There is no evidence of higher-than-average environmental concern in this segment, so the general V4 correction applies. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment data and the cross-class correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability, for which V4 mandates a substantial downward correction due to systematic over-prediction (+15pp in V3). The most relevant direct quantitative evidence is 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (7%), which is extremely low for this segment, and 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' (26%), suggesting moderate skepticism but not strong environmental engagement. There is no evidence of strong pro-environmental attitudes in this segment. The V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 23%, SD 17% (30% agreement). The segment's low environmental self-identification supports using the baseline without upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong direct quant evidence and high relevance.
Run 4: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events'), so the V4 baseline for this item is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 23%, SD 17% (30% agreement), reflecting the systematic over-prediction found in V3. Quantitative evidence from this segment shows very low self-identification as environmentalist (7%) and low trust in energy companies' environmental concern (26%), both indicating a lower-than-average environmental engagement. This suggests even less agreement than the already-lowered V4 baseline. Therefore, I further reduce agreement by 3-4pp, shifting more respondents to neutral/disagree. The final estimate is: SA 7%, A 18%, N 32%, D 25%, SD 18%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and high relevance of the evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=17.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=26.00%, Strongly disagree=19.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). However, the segment's direct quantitative evidence shows only 7% consider themselves environmentalists (very low) and just 26% think energy companies do not care about the environment (low salience). This suggests even lower agreement than the already conservative V4 baseline. No qualitative evidence suggests higher engagement. Therefore, I reduce both agreement categories by 2pp each and increase disagreement, resulting in 23% agreement (6% SA, 17% A), 32% neutral, 45% disagreement (26% SD, 19% D). This is consistent with the segment's low environmental self-identification and skepticism. Confidence is high due to strong direct quant evidence.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V3/V4 well-calibrated baseline for this low-friction, high-consensus behavior, and the segment-specific evidence (Traditional Homeowners) does not indicate any reason to deviate from the general population norm. Quantitative toplines (e.g., high spending on housing/utilities, low digital engagement, moderate support for local businesses) are not directly related to energy-saving attitudes and do not contradict the baseline. The evidence selection process is transparent and appropriate, and the confidence in the estimate is high due to the strong calibration of this item in the reference framework. No corrective feedback is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.00%
  Slightly agree: 40.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 15.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a 'Behavior (Low Friction)' but is treated as a well-calibrated concept in V4 (see prompt: 'Cut down gas/electricity at home' - KEEP V3). The V3/V4 baseline for this item is SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement), which is high and reflects broad social consensus and low friction for this behavior. The segment (Traditional Homeowners) shows no evidence of unusually high or low environmental or cost-saving attitudes, and the quantitative evidence provided is not directly related to energy-saving behaviors. Therefore, the general population baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct match with a well-calibrated concept and lack of contradictory segment evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but specifically about energy-saving behavior at home, which is well-calibrated in V4 and should use the standard: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. The segment (Traditional Homeowners) shows moderate digital engagement and a slight tendency to support local businesses, but nothing to suggest a major deviation from the general population on energy-saving attitudes. No demographic calibration is needed. Quantitative evidence is limited but does not contradict the baseline. Confidence is high due to strong V4 calibration for this concept.
Run 3: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a low-friction behavior (easy action, high social desirability, and well-calibrated in V3/V4). The V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement), and this is supported by the lack of evidence suggesting deviation for 'Traditional Homeowners'. The quantitative evidence provided does not directly relate to energy-saving attitudes, but the segment's high spending on housing/utilities (63.18) may indicate awareness of energy costs, which could reinforce the baseline. No demographic calibration is needed as this segment is not flagged as high or low income, nor is there evidence of digital or financial attitudes that would shift the baseline. Therefore, the well-calibrated V4 baseline is applied with high confidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is classified as a low-friction behavior, but V4 guidance specifies that this particular item is well-calibrated and should retain the V3 baseline: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. The segment (Traditional Homeowners) shows high spending on housing/utilities (63.18), but there is no direct evidence of unusually high or low environmental concern or energy-saving attitudes. The available quantitative attitudes (e.g., support for local businesses, digital confusion) are not directly related to energy-saving, and their low agreement rates do not justify deviation from the general template. Therefore, the general population baseline is applied. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the absence of segment-specific modifiers.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but with a strong behavioral/environmental norm, and is one of the four 'well-calibrated' concepts in V4 (error <3pp), so the baseline should be kept as: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. The segment (Traditional Homeowners) shows no evidence of unusually high or low environmental concern, digital engagement, or financial stress that would warrant deviation from the general population baseline. Quantitative evidence is neutral or unrelated to energy-saving attitudes. Therefore, the general V4 template for this concept is applied without demographic adjustment. Confidence is high due to direct mapping to a well-calibrated, cross-class stable item.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.98
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the most relevant quantitative evidence ('environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions important when buying a car' at 36%) and correctly distinguishes it from the stricter target concept ('fuel consumption is the most important feature'). The systematic V4 correction for this item is appropriately prioritized due to known over-prediction in V3, and the demographic/segment context (Traditional Homeowners) is accurately described as not warranting further adjustment. The supporting evidence (attitudes toward energy companies, insurance, pet care) is correctly deprioritized due to lower relevance. The confidence is high due to strong alignment between the evidence and the applied correction. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 25.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' V4 baseline for this concept (see prompt) is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3 and cross-class analysis. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action: 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.36), which is related but not identical (environmental concern vs. fuel economy). This value is higher than the V4 baseline agreement, but not enough to override the cross-class correction, especially since 'fuel consumption as most important' is a stricter criterion than 'environmentally friendly is important.' The other evidence (energy companies/environment, insurance, pet care) is less directly relevant. No strong demographic calibration is warranted for 'Traditional Homeowners' (middle/older, stable, not especially eco-focused). Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied with high confidence, as it matches both the evidence and the systematic correction for this item.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the V4 prompt specifies a concept-specific correction for this item due to systematic over-prediction in V3. The corrected V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the segment's own topline: 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low co2 emissions' at 36%. However, this is a broader and somewhat more popular environmental framing, not specifically about fuel consumption as the single most important feature. The V4 correction is justified because, across all classes, agreement with this specific statement is much lower than with general environmental car features. No strong demographic calibration is warranted for 'Traditional Homeowners' (middle-aged, stable, not especially green-leaning). Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong cross-class evidence and the segment's moderate environmental concern (as shown by the 36% topline for a broader item).
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the V4 template applies a concept-specific correction due to systematic over-prediction in V3. The corrected baseline for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the segment's 36% agreement with 'environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions important when buying a car' (value=0.36), which is related but not identical—fuel consumption is a narrower, more utilitarian concern than environmental friendliness. The next most relevant evidence is much lower (insurance importance at 14%). No qualitative evidence is available. The 36% topline is higher than the V4 baseline, but since the question is about 'most important feature' (a high bar), and the V4 correction is based on systematic over-prediction, I retain the V4 baseline. No demographic calibration is needed (Traditional Homeowners are not a high- or low-income outlier). Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and robust cross-class correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude' but with a high-friction behavioral implication (prioritizing fuel consumption above all else when buying a car). V4 cross-class analysis shows this item is systematically over-predicted, so the corrected baseline is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). Quantitative evidence from the segment ('environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions important when buying a car' = 36%) is higher than the V4 baseline, but this measure is broader (includes all who rate it as important, not just 'most important'). The target concept is stricter ('most important'), so actual agreement will be lower. No strong demographic calibration is warranted for 'Traditional Homeowners' (middle/older, stable, not especially green-leaning). Supporting attitudes about energy companies/environment are low (26%), reinforcing that environmental/fuel priorities are not dominant. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' According to V4, this item is subject to a moderate cross-class over-prediction error (+5pp in V3), so the corrected baseline is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the segment's 0.36 (36%) agreement with 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (relevance 0.98), which is a related but not identical concept—environmental friendliness is correlated with fuel consumption but not a perfect proxy. The next most relevant evidence is much lower (0.26 for 'energy companies do not care about the environment'), suggesting environmental concern is not dominant in this segment. No qualitative evidence suggests a higher or lower baseline. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, with no upward or downward demographic calibration needed. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchoring and high relevance.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the well-calibrated nature of this item in V4, and the use of the V3 template is appropriate given the lack of direct quantitative evidence for this specific attitude in the segment. The supporting quantitative evidence (low risk-taking, low community engagement) aligns with a cautious, traditional profile, which is consistent with moderate-to-high debt aversion, but does not directly contradict the use of the general population baseline. The confidence is high due to the strong cross-class calibration and absence of evidence suggesting deviation for this segment. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement, so the V4 attitude baseline applies: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, this concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') is one of the four well-calibrated items in V4, so the V3 values are retained: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence for this segment shows relatively low agreement with strong pro-social or risk-averse attitudes (e.g., only 22% agree climate change is the biggest threat, 18% are risk-tolerant, 8% help in the community), but these are not directly about debt aversion. There is no evidence suggesting this group is less debt-averse than the general population, so the well-calibrated baseline is appropriate. Confidence is moderate-high due to the lack of direct evidence but strong cross-class calibration for this item.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), which uses the V4 attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). However, this specific item is one of the four well-calibrated concepts in V4, so the V3 values are retained: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence from the segment shows low risk-taking (0.18) and low community engagement (0.08), both consistent with a cautious, traditional profile, which supports a moderate-to-high aversion to debt. No evidence suggests deviation from the general population for this attitude, so the well-calibrated template is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct alignment with V4 calibration and supporting segment data.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude statement. According to the V4 baseline, this concept is well-calibrated and should not be adjusted from the V3 template: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The segment (Traditional Homeowners) shows low risk-taking (0.18) and low community activism (0.08), suggesting a cautious, conservative profile, which aligns with a moderate to high aversion to debt. However, there is no direct quantitative evidence on debt aversion, so the general population baseline is most appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed, as this segment is not flagged for strong deviation. Confidence is high due to the well-calibrated nature of this item and the segment's conservative tendencies.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The item is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), which is well-calibrated in V4 and should use the standard template: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided is only weakly related (e.g., risk-taking with money at 18%, climate concern at 22%), and there is no direct evidence on debt aversion. The segment (Traditional Homeowners) is not flagged as highly distinctive for debt attitudes, so no demographic calibration is applied. The evidence hierarchy prioritizes direct quantitative data, but none is available for this exact item; thus, the general V4 attitude baseline is used. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration for this concept.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude item. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the standard template: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence from this segment shows relatively low agreement with strong statements (e.g., only 22% agree that climate change is the biggest threat, and only 8% help out in the community), suggesting a generally moderate to low tendency to strongly agree with attitudinal statements. However, there is no direct evidence to suggest this group is more tolerant of debt than the general population, nor is there evidence of a strong aversion. Therefore, the baseline V4 distribution is appropriate. Confidence is high due to the direct match with the well-calibrated template and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.80
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 cross-class correction for identity statements, specifically for the concept 'I am very good at managing money,' and explains the use of the -6pp adjustment from V3 due to systematic over-prediction. The segment (Traditional Homeowners) is described as stable and financially prudent, with supporting quantitative evidence (e.g., 25% manage savings online, high private car ownership) that neither contradicts nor strongly supports a deviation from the V4 baseline. The absence of direct attitudinal data is acknowledged, but the evidence hierarchy and calibration logic are applied correctly. No further demographic calibration is warranted based on the provided evidence. The confidence level is high due to the strong methodological fit and lack of contradictory data.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 34.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. V4 baseline for this is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, the V4 cross-class correction for this concept is to reduce agreement by 6pp from V3, resulting in SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). Quantitative evidence is limited but does not contradict this: 25% manage savings online (suggests moderate financial engagement), and the segment is 'Traditional Homeowners' (typically stable, older, financially prudent). No evidence suggests a need for further demographic calibration. Therefore, the V4 corrected identity baseline is applied. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and segment fit.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is classified as an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity concepts is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, for this specific concept, V4 applies a moderate correction (-6pp from V3) due to consistent over-prediction, resulting in SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). The Traditional Homeowners segment is not flagged for any further demographic calibration (they are not especially affluent or constrained), so the general V4 correction is appropriate. Quantitative evidence does not directly address self-perceived money management, but the segment's high rate of private car ownership and moderate online savings management suggest a stable, financially literate group, supporting the use of the corrected identity baseline. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with V4's cross-class calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. V4 baseline for this is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, the segment (Traditional Homeowners) is likely to be somewhat above average in financial self-efficacy: they are older, stable, and have high rates of private car ownership (87%), and a moderate rate of online savings management (25%). There is no direct quantitative evidence of high or low self-assessed money management, but nothing suggests a major deviation from the V4 baseline. The V4 correction for this concept is -6pp from V3, so the baseline is SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9%. No demographic calibration is needed (Traditional Homeowners are not especially affluent or deprived). Confidence is moderate-high due to strong segment stability and the identity nature of the item.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is classified as an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity concepts is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, the V4 cross-class correction for this specific concept is to reduce agreement by 6pp due to consistent over-prediction in V3, resulting in SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). The Traditional Homeowners segment is not flagged for further demographic calibration (no strong evidence of higher or lower self-assessed financial competence), and the provided quantitative evidence (e.g., 25% manage savings online, high car ownership, low crime worry) does not suggest a significant deviation from the general population for this attitude. Therefore, the corrected V4 identity template for this concept is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the well-calibrated V4 correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for this concept is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), which already incorporates a -6pp correction for systematic over-prediction found in V3. The segment 'Traditional Homeowners' is likely to have moderate-to-high self-assessed financial competence, but there is no direct quantitative evidence in the provided data to justify further upward or downward adjustment. The closest relevant quantitative evidence (e.g., 25% manage savings online, high private car ownership) suggests financial stability but not necessarily above-average self-assessed money management. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong concept-specific calibration and segment fit, but not maximal due to lack of direct attitudinal data.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 guidance that this attitude item ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline. The quantitative toplines for the Traditional Homeowners segment do not indicate any unusual risk aversion or insurance prioritization, with the most relevant attitude ('fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') showing low agreement (14%). There is no evidence in the provided data to warrant deviation from the baseline. The qualitative context is acknowledged as missing, but this does not undermine the justification given the strong quantitative alignment and the well-calibrated status of the concept. Confidence is high that the estimate is grounded in the evidence provided.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything', which is an attitude item. According to the V4 prompt, this concept is among those that are well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The segment (Traditional Homeowners) shows no evidence of unusually high or low insurance focus in the quantitative toplines, and the most relevant attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is low (0.14), suggesting a pragmatic, not especially risk-averse or insurance-focused group. No demographic calibration is warranted. Therefore, the well-calibrated baseline is applied directly. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and strong cross-class calibration for this concept.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this item is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The quantitative evidence for this segment (Traditional Homeowners) shows low agreement with similar 'importance' attitudes (e.g., only 14% agree that fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car), suggesting a pragmatic, possibly cost-conscious approach. There is no evidence of unusually high insurance prioritization in the provided data. No demographic calibration is needed, as this segment is not flagged for strong deviation. Therefore, the standard V4 distribution is applied with high confidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything', which is classified as an attitude. According to the V4 prompt, this concept is among those that are well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The quantitative evidence for this segment (Traditional Homeowners) does not indicate unusually high risk aversion or insurance prioritization (e.g., 'fuel consumption is the most important feature' is only 14%, and other values are moderate). There is no evidence to suggest this group is more likely to strongly agree with the importance of being well insured. Therefore, the general baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct alignment with the V4 template and lack of segment-specific deviation.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The quantitative evidence from the segment ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' at 14%) suggests a relatively low tendency to prioritize risk-averse or precautionary attitudes, which aligns with the baseline. No segment-specific evidence suggests a higher or lower agreement than the general population. The qualitative context is missing, so no upward or downward adjustment is warranted. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and the concept being well-calibrated in prior rounds.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is an attitude item. According to the V4 prompt, this specific concept is classified as 'well-calibrated' and should retain the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence from this segment ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' at 14%) suggests a relatively low tendency to prioritize risk-averse or cautious attitudes, which aligns with the baseline. There is no evidence of unusually high insurance concern in the provided data. Therefore, the general population baseline is appropriate, and no demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative alignment and the concept's well-calibrated status in V3/V4.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes among Traditional Homeowners is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 correction for systematic over-prediction, and the topline quantitative evidence (very high meat-eating, low vegan/vegetarian rates) supports the conclusion that actual dietary change is rare in this segment. The estimate is appropriately cautious, reflecting attitudes rather than behaviors, and does not overstate agreement. The absence of strong qualitative evidence for higher health focus further supports the conservative baseline. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and methodological consistency across runs.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 26.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3) across all classes, so the baseline is set at 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows this segment is overwhelmingly meat-eating (82%), with very low vegan (0.8%) and vegetarian (4.4%) rates, and a moderate pescatarian/flexitarian/other (13.7%). This suggests that while healthy eating may be valued in the abstract, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive 'healthy' diets, supporting the lower agreement baseline. No strong qualitative evidence is present to override this. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied without upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class consistency.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is set at 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows this segment is overwhelmingly meat-eating (82%), with very low vegan (0.8%) and vegetarian (4.4%) rates, and moderate pescatarian/flexitarian (13.7%). This suggests that while healthy eating as an attitude may be present, actual dietary change is rare, supporting the need for a lower agreement estimate. No qualitative evidence suggests unusually high health focus. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, and no upward demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment with the V4 correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is now 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). Quantitative evidence shows this segment is overwhelmingly meat-eating (82%), with very low vegan (0.8%) and vegetarian (4.4%) rates, and a moderate pescatarian/flexitarian/other (13.7%). This suggests healthy eating is not a dominant behavioral norm, but the question is about attitude, not behavior. There is no evidence of unusually high or low health attitudes, so the general V4 correction is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and the cross-class correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is set at 38% agreement (SA+A). Quantitative evidence shows this segment is overwhelmingly meat-eating (82%), with very low vegan (0.8%) and vegetarian (4.4%) rates, and moderate pescatarian/flexitarian (13.7%). This suggests a traditional diet, likely less health-focused than average, so the V4 baseline is appropriate or possibly even slightly high. No strong qualitative evidence to suggest higher agreement. Therefore, I apply the V4 corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' without upward demographic adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is set at 38% agreement (SA+A). The quantitative evidence shows this segment is overwhelmingly meat-eating (82%), with very low vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) rates, and a moderate minority (14%) in pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may value healthy eating, their actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. This supports the V4 correction: agreement is likely lower than average. No demographic calibration is needed (Traditional Homeowners are not a high-variance class for this concept). The distribution is thus: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and V4 cross-class correction.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 baseline for the attitude statement, which is directly relevant to the concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 13% plan to use other investments for retirement, 31% only save for a specific purpose) is not directly contradictory and does not indicate a need for deviation from the baseline. The qualitative segment profile (Traditional Homeowners) is not flagged for strong demographic deviation, and the evidence hierarchy is respected. The repeated high-confidence rationale across runs, with explicit reference to the evidence and the correction applied from V3 to V4, supports the validity of the estimate. No further adjustment or additional evidence is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.00%
  Slightly disagree: 13.00%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is used: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). The segment (Traditional Homeowners) is not flagged for strong demographic deviation, and the provided quantitative evidence (e.g., 13% plan to use other investments for retirement, 31% only save for a specific purpose) does not suggest a major shift from the baseline. The evidence hierarchy prioritizes the concept-specific V4 correction (-3pp from V3), and no strong evidence to further adjust up or down is present. Confidence is high due to direct concept match and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is applied: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). This is a moderate correction from V3, reflecting a slight over-prediction bias previously. The segment (Traditional Homeowners) is not strongly demographically distinct from the general population in a way that would justify a further adjustment (e.g., not especially affluent or deprived, and not especially young or old). The closest quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (13% agree), which is much lower, but this is a behavior/plan, not an attitude, and so not directly comparable. Other attitudes (e.g., 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 32%) are in a similar range to the V4 baseline for attitudes. Therefore, the V4 template is used without further demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the V4 cross-class correction and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' with identity overtones, but V4 treats 'retirement is your responsibility' as a moderately over-predicted item in V3, so applies a -3pp correction to the agreement baseline. For Traditional Homeowners, there is no strong evidence of deviation from the general population: their attitudes toward financial planning (e.g., 13% plan to use other investments for retirement, 31% only save for a specific purpose) suggest moderate engagement but not strong collectivist or state-reliant views. No evidence suggests they are less likely to agree with personal responsibility for retirement than the baseline. Therefore, use the V4 corrected template: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). Quantitative evidence is only weakly related, so no further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class consistency and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but closely aligns with 'identity' for this segment, as Traditional Homeowners are typically older, stable, and more likely to see retirement as a personal responsibility. V4's baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is 25/35/18/13/9 (60% agreement), already incorporating a -3pp correction for prior over-prediction. Quantitative evidence is limited but does not contradict this: only 13% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting reliance on self/familiar means), and attitudes toward financial self-management are moderate (e.g., 31% only save for a purpose, 32% see switching utilities as worth the effort). No evidence suggests a lower sense of personal responsibility than the general population. Demographic calibration is not needed, as this class is not especially high or low income. Therefore, the V4 corrected template is applied directly, with high confidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is an attitude item. V4 baseline for this concept is 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 18% neither, 13% slightly disagree, 9% strongly disagree (60% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3 due to mild over-prediction (+3pp). Quantitative evidence from this segment (Traditional Homeowners) shows relatively low intent to use other investments for retirement (13%), moderate agreement with saving for specific purposes (31%), and moderate trust in price comparison sites (53%). The segment is likely to value self-reliance and traditional financial attitudes, but the evidence does not suggest a need to adjust the V4 baseline. No strong demographic calibration is warranted (Traditional Homeowners are not a high-variance group for this item). Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between the segment profile and the V4 baseline, and the presence of relevant quantitative anchors.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. All runs consistently apply the well-calibrated V4 baseline for the attitude statement, with clear rationale for not deviating from this baseline. The quantitative evidence (notably high outgoings on utilities) is acknowledged but correctly interpreted as not providing direct evidence for higher or lower agreement with the statement. The qualitative and segment profile evidence is also appropriately considered, with no contradictory or compelling reason to adjust the baseline. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the rationale for each run is transparent and consistent. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related expenses, which could suggest some awareness of utility costs, but there is no direct evidence of high switching activity or strong positive attitudes toward switching. The segment's profile (Traditional Homeowners) does not indicate unusually high friction or enthusiasm for switching, so no demographic calibration is applied. The evidence hierarchy is respected, with quantitative data supporting the baseline but not justifying deviation. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the well-calibrated baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude (not high friction behavior), so the V4 baseline for 'Switching utilities worth effort' is used: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about attitudes to switching, but the segment's high outgoings on utilities (3220.54 per year) and moderate engagement with sporting events (0.19) suggest a traditional, possibly less price-sensitive group. However, the V4 baseline is already well-calibrated for this concept (V3 error -2.1pp), so no further adjustment is needed. No demographic calibration is applied, as the segment is not flagged as high or low income, nor especially young or elderly. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the well-calibrated V4 baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about switching utilities in the provided data, but the segment's high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related expenses (3220.54 per year) suggest that utility costs are salient. However, 'Traditional Homeowners' are likely to be older, more settled, and less likely to switch providers due to inertia or satisfaction with current arrangements, which is supported by the relatively low sporting event attendance (0.19) and places of worship (0.07), indicating lower overall activity levels. Therefore, I slightly increase 'neither' and 'disagree' at the expense of 'agree', resulting in: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. This maintains the V4 variance and is consistent with the well-calibrated baseline for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with V4 guidance and segment characteristics.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated in the general population (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%), and no systematic over- or under-prediction was found in cross-class analysis. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related expenses, which could make switching more salient, but there is no direct evidence that this segment is more likely to agree with the statement. Qualitative notes are neutral and do not indicate a strong attitude either way. Therefore, the general V4 baseline for this attitude is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the absence of segment-specific deviation.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should retain the V3 baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement). The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (3220.54/year), which could motivate some to consider switching, but the segment's traditional profile and relatively low engagement with change-oriented behaviors (as inferred from low sporting event and worship attendance) suggest inertia. No segment-specific evidence suggests a higher or lower propensity than the general baseline. Therefore, the general V4 baseline is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the absence of conflicting data.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.81
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The topline quantitative evidence shows that Traditional Homeowners have lower online purchase rates for routine items (alcoholic drinks, pet care), but moderate rates for higher-value or less frequent purchases (home appliances, holidays). This supports the rationale that they are less digitally engaged for everyday transactions, which aligns with a moderate preference for cash. The qualitative profile does not indicate extreme traditionalism or demographic factors (such as advanced age or low income) that would warrant a significant upward adjustment from the V4 baseline. All runs consistently apply the V4 baseline, and the rationale is clearly articulated and well-supported by the evidence. No further adjustment or additional evidence is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 24.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For 'Traditional Homeowners', the quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks: 21%, pet care: 19%), and moderate rates for higher-value/less frequent items (home appliances: 50%, holiday/travel: 57%). This suggests a segment that is less digitally oriented for routine purchases, likely preferring traditional payment methods such as cash. The V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is 13% strongly agree, 24% slightly agree, 28% neither, 22% slightly disagree, 13% strongly disagree (37% agreement). Given the segment's profile and the low online purchase rates for routine goods, this baseline is appropriate and does not require upward adjustment. There is no evidence to suggest a higher or lower preference for cash than the general population, so the V4 baseline is applied. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and clear segment characteristics.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For V4, the general baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate preference for cash, but not a majority. Quantitative evidence shows that Traditional Homeowners have relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 19%), but higher for home appliances (50%) and holidays (57%). This suggests a segment that is less digitally engaged for routine purchases, supporting a slightly higher than average preference for cash. However, the V4 correction for this concept is only -3pp from V3, and the evidence does not justify a further upward adjustment. No strong demographic calibration is warranted, as Traditional Homeowners are not the most elderly or lowest income group. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative alignment and well-calibrated V4 baseline.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For 'Traditional Homeowners', the quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 19%), but higher for home appliances (50%) and holiday/travel (57%). This suggests a segment that is less digitally engaged for routine purchases, consistent with a moderate preference for cash. The V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is 13/24/28/22/13 (37% agreement), and the evidence does not justify a strong upward or downward adjustment: the segment is somewhat traditional but not extremely so, and the online rates for non-routine purchases are not low enough to warrant a higher cash preference. No demographic calibration is needed. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and concept fit.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For 'Traditional Homeowners', the quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 19%), but higher for home appliances (50%) and holidays (57%). This suggests a moderate but not overwhelming preference for traditional (offline/cash) transactions, especially for routine purchases. The V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is 13/24/28/22/13 (37% agreement), which fits this segment well. No strong demographic calibration is needed, as this group is not extremely elderly or low-income, and the evidence does not suggest a major deviation from the baseline. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and well-calibrated V4 template.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For V4, the general baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate but not overwhelming preference for cash. Quantitative evidence shows that Traditional Homeowners have relatively low rates of online purchasing for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 19%), but higher for home appliances (50%) and holidays (57%). This suggests a segment that is less digitally engaged for routine purchases, which aligns with a somewhat higher preference for cash than the UK average, but not dramatically so. No direct evidence suggests a need to deviate from the V4 baseline. Qualitative profile hints at traditional behaviors, but not enough to warrant a demographic calibration. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied without adjustment. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment between segment behavior and the baseline template.
