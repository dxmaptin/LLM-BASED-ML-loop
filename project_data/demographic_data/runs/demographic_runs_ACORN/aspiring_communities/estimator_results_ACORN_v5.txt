### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.65
Critic confidence: 0.80
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The quantitative toplines are low in value and relevance, and do not directly pertain to the general attitude concept being estimated. The qualitative notes are minimal and do not provide strong direction for adjustment. The rationale for each run correctly identifies that the baseline attitude template is most appropriate in the absence of high-relevance, direct evidence. The confidence level is appropriately set as moderate due to the lack of direct evidence. No corrective action is needed; the approach is methodologically sound given the available data.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The concept type is classified as 'attitude', which has a baseline distribution of SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2-3%) is low and relates to specific behaviors rather than general attitudes, and the relevance is below the threshold for direct override. No strong demographic calibrations are indicated by the evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude template is most appropriate, with no major adjustments. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct, high-relevance quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the baseline template is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%) is low and not directly relevant to a general attitude concept, and the qualitative notes are not informative. No strong demographic or evidence-based reason to deviate from the attitude baseline. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the baseline template is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%) is low and only weakly related to the target attitude, with relevance scores below 0.8. No direct quantitative evidence for the core attitude is present, so the baseline is not overridden. Qualitative notes are minimal and do not suggest a strong deviation from the baseline. Demographic calibrations are not applied due to lack of specific segment information. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is used, with moderate confidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the baseline template is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account by phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account by phone' at 2-3%) is low and only weakly related to the target attitude concept, with relevance scores below 0.8. There is no direct quantitative evidence for the specific attitude in question, so the baseline is most appropriate. Demographic calibrations are not applied due to lack of clear demographic direction in the evidence. Confidence is moderate due to the absence of direct evidence and reliance on the general attitude baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The concept type is classified as 'attitude', which has a baseline distribution of SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2-3%) is low and not directly relevant to a general attitude concept, and the country of birth data is not directly related to attitudes. No strong evidence suggests deviation from the attitude baseline. Demographic calibrations are not applicable due to lack of specific demographic focus in the evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude template is used. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.92
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence ('I consider myself an environmentalist' at 7.6% and 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' at 26.6%), both of which are directly related to the target concept. The qualitative note about caring for the environment but not paying extra is appropriately used to temper expectations of strong agreement. The baseline attitude distribution is cited and the adjustments (lower agreement, higher neutrality/disagreement) are well explained and consistently applied across runs. There is no evidence of over- or under-weighting any particular source, and demographic calibration is correctly deprioritized due to lack of relevant cues. The confidence is moderate-high due to strong direct evidence. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.80%
  Slightly disagree: 22.20%
  Strongly disagree: 16.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement about brands considering environmental sustainability at events. The most relevant direct quantitative evidence is 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (value=0.08, relevance=0.98), which is very low and suggests weak personal identification with environmentalism in this segment. The related attitude 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' (value=0.27, relevance=0.84) indicates some skepticism about corporate environmental concern, but not strong pro-environmental sentiment. Qualitative notes reinforce that while there is some care about the environment, it does not translate into willingness to pay or strong action. The baseline for attitudes is moderate agreement (SA 10%, A 27%), but the direct evidence here is much lower, so the distribution is shifted toward disagreement and neutrality. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated by the evidence. Overall, agreement is below baseline, with a majority neutral or disagreeing.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'Attitude' (opinion about brands and environmental sustainability). The closest direct quantitative evidence is 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (value=0.08, very low agreement, relevance=0.98), and 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' (value=0.27, moderate disagreement, relevance=0.84). Qualitative notes indicate some environmental concern but unwillingness to pay extra, suggesting weak but present environmental attitudes. The attitude baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the very low direct agreement with environmentalist identity and moderate skepticism toward companies, I shift the distribution toward more neutrality and disagreement: slightly reduce agreement, increase neutral and disagreement. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated here. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong direct evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events'). The direct quantitative evidence for related environmental attitudes in this segment is low: only 7.6% consider themselves environmentalists (very close conceptual match, high relevance), and 26.6% think energy companies do not care about the environment (moderate relevance). Qualitative notes indicate that while there is some environmental concern, it is not strong enough to drive costly behavior. The attitude baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low direct agreement on environmental identity and moderate skepticism about companies' environmental concern, I adjust the agreement downward (SA/A combined to 31%, slightly below baseline). Disagreement is increased slightly to reflect the segment's weak environmental self-concept. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated here. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong direct evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is Attitude. The most relevant direct quantitative evidence is 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (value=0.08, relevance=0.98), which is very low and suggests low agreement with strong environmental identity. The related attitude 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' (value=0.27, relevance=0.84) is also low, indicating skepticism or disengagement. Qualitative notes reinforce that while there is some concern for the environment, it does not translate into strong action or willingness to pay extra. The baseline for Attitude is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the very low direct evidence, I shift the distribution downward, reducing agreement and increasing neutrality/disagreement. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated here. Final estimate: agreement (SA+A) is 30%, with a high neutral/disagree segment, reflecting weak environmentalist identity in this segment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude ("I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events"). The direct quantitative evidence for related attitudes in this segment is low: only 7.6% consider themselves environmentalists (very close conceptual match, high relevance), and 26.6% think energy companies do not care about the environment (less direct, but still relevant). Qualitative notes indicate some concern for the environment but unwillingness to pay extra, suggesting low to moderate attitudinal agreement but not strong conviction. The attitude baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low direct agreement on environmentalist identity, I reduce both agree categories slightly and increase neutral/disagree. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated here (no strong age/income/urban cues), so the main adjustment is based on the low direct evidence. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong direct evidence.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.77
Critic confidence: 0.92
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale consistently recognizes the lack of direct evidence for the specific attitude but appropriately uses the high outgoings on housing/utilities as a relevant contextual factor. The closest attitude proxy ('support local businesses') is acknowledged as weakly related and low, and the qualitative notes about planning and shopping are correctly interpreted as only weakly indicative of conscientiousness. The repeated use of the low-friction behavior baseline is methodologically sound, as the target concept is a low-friction, pro-environmental attitude. The confidence level is appropriately moderate-high, reflecting the indirect but relevant evidence. No major evidence or logic gaps are present, and no demographic or other calibration is warranted based on the data. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 32.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 24.00%
  Slightly disagree: 18.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=24.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude about making an effort to reduce gas/electricity use at home. This is a moderately positive, low-friction behavior/attitude (it is about intention/effort, not actual costly change). The concept type baseline for low-friction behavior is SA 13%, A 32%, N 24%, D 18%, SD 13%. Quantitative evidence from this segment shows high outgoings on housing/utilities (79%), but no direct evidence of energy-saving attitudes or behaviors. The closest attitude proxy ('I make an effort to support local businesses') is low (14%), but this is a different domain and likely reflects a higher friction/cost. Qualitative notes suggest planning and weekly shopping, which may indicate some conscientiousness but not directly about energy. No strong evidence to shift from the baseline. Demographic calibrations are not triggered by the evidence provided. Therefore, the baseline for low-friction behavior is most appropriate, with moderate confidence due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=24.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home'), but it borders on low-friction behavior since it refers to effortful intent rather than actual costly change. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the very high outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels (79.45), which suggests this segment is highly exposed to energy costs and may be motivated to reduce them. However, direct attitude evidence for similar pro-local or pro-digital behaviors is low (14% agreement for supporting local businesses, 26% for liking chatbots), indicating this segment is not especially high on positive attitudes. Qualitative notes about planning and weekly grocery shopping suggest some conscientiousness, but not necessarily strong pro-environmental or cost-saving attitudes. Given the evidence, the best fit is the Low Friction Behavior baseline (SA 13%, A 32%, N 24%, D 18%, SD 13%), with no strong reason to adjust up or down. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated by the evidence. Confidence is moderate-high due to the clear evidence hierarchy and concept type fit.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=24.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home'), but it borders on a low-friction behavior since it refers to effortful intent in a common household context. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the high outgoings on housing/utilities (79.45), which suggests this segment is highly exposed to energy costs and thus likely to be motivated to reduce usage. However, the closest direct attitude evidence ('I make an effort to support local businesses', 0.14) is much lower than the attitude baseline, indicating this segment may under-index on self-reported pro-social efforts. Qualitative notes suggest planning and weekly grocery shopping, which implies some conscientiousness but not necessarily strong pro-environmental or cost-saving attitudes. Given the lack of direct evidence for energy-saving attitudes and the moderate relevance of related behaviors, I use the low-friction behavior baseline (SA 13%, A 32%, N 24%, D 18%, SD 13%) without major demographic adjustment. Confidence is moderate-high due to the strong evidence of high utility spending, but the lack of direct attitude evidence tempers this.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=24.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude: 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home.' The concept type baseline for attitudes is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, this is a low-friction, pro-environmental attitude, which often sees slightly higher agreement, so the low-friction behavior baseline (SA 13%, A 32%, N 24%, D 18%, SD 13%) is more appropriate. 

Direct quantitative evidence is not available for this exact item, but the segment spends heavily on housing/utilities (79%), suggesting high relevance of the topic. The closest attitude proxy ('I make an effort to support local businesses') is low (14% agreement), but this is a different domain. Qualitative notes indicate planning and weekly grocery shopping, which suggests some conscientiousness, but not specifically about energy use. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated here. 

Given the lack of direct evidence but the relevance of the topic and the general tendency for people to agree with low-friction, pro-environmental statements, the low-friction behavior baseline is used. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence but supported by general patterns.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=24.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home'), but it borders on low-friction behavior since it refers to effortful intent in a common household context. No direct quantitative evidence is provided for this exact item, but the segment spends heavily on housing/utilities (79%), which may indicate awareness of energy costs. However, the closest attitude proxy ('I make an effort to support local businesses') is low (14%), suggesting this segment is not highly proactive in positive community/behavioral attitudes. Qualitative notes indicate planning and weekly grocery shopping, which hints at some conscientiousness. Given the lack of direct evidence, I use the Low Friction Behavior baseline (SA 13%, A 32%, N 24%, D 18%, SD 13%), as this is a common, easy-to-agree-with pro-environmental/financial action. Demographic calibrations are not applied due to lack of clear directionality. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong concept-type fit but limited direct evidence.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The runs consistently use the most relevant quantitative evidence ('Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions', value=0.39, relevance=0.98), which is closely related to the target concept, though not identical. The qualitative note about environmental concern but reluctance to pay extra is appropriately used to temper the predicted agreement. The attitude baseline is transparently referenced and only minor, evidence-based adjustments are made. The rationale in each run is clear about the relationship between the evidence and the prediction, and the absence of demographic calibration is justified by the lack of segment-specific data. The evidence selection rationale is also sound, ensuring both quantitative and qualitative context is considered. Overall, the prediction is well-grounded in the provided evidence and the reasoning is methodologically appropriate.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.40%
  Slightly agree: 27.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.40%
  Slightly disagree: 19.20%
  Strongly disagree: 14.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=11.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the 0.39 agreement for 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (relevance 0.98), which is closely related but not identical—fuel consumption is a broader, more practical concern than environmental friendliness, but the two are correlated. The qualitative note suggests that while environmental concern exists, it does not dominate purchase decisions, supporting a moderate agreement. The attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%) fits well, and the direct evidence (0.39) is very close to this. No major demographic calibrations are needed for this segment. Therefore, the baseline is used with a slight nudge toward agreement, matching the evidence. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative data.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.39, relevance=0.98), which is closely related but not identical—environmental friendliness overlaps with fuel consumption but is not a perfect proxy. The baseline for attitudes is: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The evidence (0.39) is very close to the attitude baseline (0.37), so only minor adjustment is needed. Qualitative notes indicate environmental concern but reluctance to pay extra, suggesting that while fuel consumption is valued, it is not overwhelmingly prioritized. No strong demographic calibration is warranted for this segment. Therefore, the baseline is maintained with a slight nudge toward agreement, resulting in: SA 10%, A 28%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 14%.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' The most relevant quantitative evidence is the proportion who say 'environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' is important when buying a car (value=0.39, relevance=0.98). This is a closely related but not identical concept—fuel consumption is a practical/financial concern, while environmental friendliness is more abstract, but they are correlated. The qualitative note suggests this segment cares about the environment but is price sensitive, implying fuel economy may be valued, but not above all else. The direct evidence (0.39) is slightly above the attitude baseline (0.37 agreement), so I nudge agreement up a bit. The distribution is centered around neutral, with a slight tilt toward agreement, reflecting moderate importance but not dominance of this feature. No strong demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence. Confidence is high due to strong direct evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=29.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the 0.39 agreement for 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (relevance 0.98), which is closely related but not identical—fuel consumption is a broader, more practical concern than environmental friendliness, but the two are correlated. The baseline for attitudes is 37% agreement (SA+A), and the direct evidence is 39%. Qualitative notes indicate that while environmental concern exists, it does not translate into willingness to pay extra, suggesting moderate agreement but not strong. Demographic calibrations are not applied as no specific segment is indicated. The final distribution is slightly above the attitude baseline, with a modest tilt toward agreement, but a substantial neutral and disagreement share, reflecting the evidence and the typical spread for attitudinal items.
Run 5: Strongly agree=11.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=29.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is Attitude ("Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car"). The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low co2 emissions' (value=0.39, relevance=0.98), which is closely related but not identical—fuel consumption is broader than just environmental friendliness. The baseline for Attitude is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The evidence (0.39) matches the baseline agreement (37%), so only minor adjustment is needed. Qualitative notes indicate environmental concern but reluctance to prioritize it above cost or other features, supporting a moderate neutral/disagreement share. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. Final distribution is close to baseline, with a slight nudge toward neutral/disagree to reflect the evidence and qualitative context.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 2
Estimator average confidence: 0.78
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently applies the evidence hierarchy: it starts from the attitude baseline (37% agreement), then uses the most relevant quantitative proxy ('I do not mind taking risks with my money' at 20% agreement) to justify a moderate upward adjustment in agreement with 'I don't like the idea of being in debt.' The qualitative evidence is correctly identified as only weakly relevant and is not over-weighted. The adjustment to 50% agreement (SA+A) is reasonable and proportionally distributed, with disagreement and neutral responses adjusted accordingly. The rationale is transparent, avoids over-extrapolation, and maintains methodological rigor. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 32.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 16.00%
  Strongly disagree: 12.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=16.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'). The attitude baseline is 37% agreement (SA+A). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the low agreement (20%) with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money,' indicating risk aversion, which is a reasonable proxy for debt aversion. This justifies a moderate upward adjustment to agreement, but not a shift to the identity baseline. The qualitative evidence (planning ahead, shopping weekly) is only weakly related and is not heavily weighted. Therefore, I increase agreement by about 13pp (to 50% agreement), distributing the increase proportionally to SA and A. Disagreement is reduced accordingly, and the neutral category is slightly reduced to maintain variance. This approach aligns with the evidence hierarchy and avoids over-weighting proxies or qualitative hints.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=16.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude' (about debt aversion). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the low agreement (20%) with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money,' indicating risk aversion, which correlates moderately with debt aversion. There is no direct evidence about debt attitudes, so the attitude baseline (37% agreement) is used. The risk aversion proxy justifies a moderate upward adjustment (+10-15pp), resulting in total agreement around 50%. Qualitative evidence (planning ahead, shopping weekly) is only weakly related and is not heavily weighted. The final distribution reflects a moderate increase over the attitude baseline, but does not reach identity-level agreement. Confidence is moderate-high due to the clear proxy evidence but lack of direct measurement.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=16.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'). The attitude baseline is 37% agreement (SA+A). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the low agreement (20%) with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money,' indicating risk aversion, which is a reasonable proxy for debt aversion. This justifies a moderate upward adjustment to the baseline, but not a shift to the identity baseline. The qualitative evidence (planning ahead, shopping weekly) weakly supports cautiousness but should not be heavily weighted. Therefore, I increase agreement by about 13pp (to 50% agreement), distributing this primarily to 'slightly agree' and 'strongly agree.' Disagreement is reduced proportionally. This approach aligns with the evidence hierarchy and avoids over-weighting proxies or qualitative hints.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=16.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') is an attitude statement. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the low agreement (20%) with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money,' indicating risk aversion, which is moderately correlated with debt aversion. There is no direct evidence about debt attitudes, so the attitude baseline (37% agreement) is the starting point. Given the risk aversion proxy, a moderate upward adjustment of 10-13pp is justified, resulting in total agreement around 50%. The qualitative evidence (planning ahead, shopping weekly) is only weakly related and does not warrant further adjustment. The final estimate is: Strongly agree 18%, Slightly agree 32%, Neither 22%, Slightly disagree 16%, Strongly disagree 12%. Confidence is moderate-high due to the strong proxy but lack of direct evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=16.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'). The attitude baseline is 37% agreement (SA+A). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the low agreement (20%) with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money,' indicating risk aversion and, by extension, likely debt aversion. This justifies a moderate upward adjustment to agreement. The qualitative evidence (planning ahead, shopping weekly) weakly supports cautiousness but is not strongly related to debt attitudes and is given minimal weight. Following the evidence hierarchy, I increase agreement by about 13pp (to 50% agreement), distributing this increase proportionally to SA and A. Disagreement is reduced accordingly. No identity baseline is used, as there is no direct evidence of strong debt aversion. The final estimate is: SA 18%, A 32%, N 22%, D 16%, SD 12%. Confidence is moderate-high due to the clear proxy evidence for risk aversion.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.80
Critic confidence: 0.92
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I am very good at managing money' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale correctly identifies the target as an identity statement, for which a baseline template is appropriate in the absence of direct, segment-specific evidence. The quantitative data (e.g., 29% manage savings online, high car ownership) is only tangentially related to self-perceived money management skill and does not contradict the baseline. The qualitative notes do not provide relevant context for financial self-concept. The repeated use of the identity baseline, with clear explanation and acknowledgment of evidence limitations, is methodologically sound. No major revisions are needed, though future estimates could be improved with more direct measures of financial self-concept or segment-specific demographic calibration.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 22.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.00%
  Slightly disagree: 15.00%
  Strongly disagree: 10.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=22.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=15.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is an identity statement ('I am very good at managing money'), which typically yields higher agreement (baseline: SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%). The quantitative evidence is only weakly related: 29% manage savings online (suggests some financial engagement), but this is a behavior, not a self-concept. No direct evidence on self-assessed money management skill is present, so the identity baseline is most appropriate. Demographic calibrations are not applied due to lack of clear segment direction. Qualitative notes (media use) do not directly inform financial self-concept. Thus, the baseline identity template is used with moderate confidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=22.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=15.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') is an identity statement, which typically yields higher agreement (baseline: SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%). The quantitative evidence is mostly tangential (e.g., 29% manage savings online, high car ownership, moderate spending on miscellaneous goods), but none directly contradicts a positive self-concept in money management. No evidence suggests this segment is especially poor at managing money. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated by the evidence, so the identity baseline is most appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the identity template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=22.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=15.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an identity statement ('I am very good at managing money'), which typically yields higher agreement (baseline: SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%). The quantitative evidence provided is only weakly related: the proportion managing savings online (29%) is a low-friction behavior, but not a direct identity measure. The high rate of private car ownership (87%) and moderate miscellaneous spending (41%) suggest some financial stability, but do not directly indicate self-perceived money management skill. No evidence directly contradicts the identity baseline, and no strong demographic cues are present to adjust the baseline. Therefore, the identity template is used with no significant calibration. Confidence is high due to strong concept-type fit, but not maximal due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=22.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=15.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') is an identity statement, which typically yields higher agreement (baseline: SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%). The quantitative evidence is mostly tangential: 29% manage savings online (suggests some financial engagement), but no direct measure of self-perceived money management skill. No evidence suggests this segment is especially weak or strong in this area. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated by the evidence. Therefore, the identity baseline is most appropriate, with no major adjustments. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong concept-type fit but lack of direct quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=22.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=15.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is an identity statement ('I am very good at managing money'), which typically yields higher agreement (baseline: SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%). The direct quantitative evidence is limited: 29% manage savings accounts online (suggesting moderate financial engagement), but this is a behavior, not self-concept. No evidence suggests this group is especially poor or excellent at money management. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated by the evidence. Therefore, the identity baseline is most appropriate, with no major adjustments. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong concept-type fit and lack of conflicting evidence.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 2
Estimator average confidence: 0.62
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale for each run is transparent about the lack of direct evidence for insurance attitudes and the weak relevance of the closest quantitative proxy ('fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'). The qualitative note about planning is appropriately treated as only weakly relevant. The approach of starting from a baseline attitude distribution and making only slight downward adjustments to agreement is methodologically sound, given the evidence hierarchy and the weak proxies. Confidence is appropriately rated as moderate. No major corrective feedback is needed, though future estimates would benefit from any direct evidence on insurance attitudes if it becomes available.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.80%
  Slightly agree: 24.60%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 21.40%
  Strongly disagree: 15.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.62 / Rationale: Concept type is 'Attitude', so the baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about insurance attitudes for this segment. The closest quantitative proxy is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.13), which suggests low prioritization of risk-averse or precautionary features. Qualitative evidence ('plan in advance and shop for groceries weekly') hints at some planning tendency, but this is weakly related to insurance attitudes. Given the lack of direct evidence and only weakly relevant proxies, I weight the attitude baseline at 80% and the proxy evidence at 20%. The low value for the car fuel consumption attitude suggests a slight downward adjustment from the baseline for agreement. Therefore, I reduce agreement by 5pp and increase neutral/disagreement accordingly. Demographic calibrations are not applied due to lack of clear directionality. Confidence is moderate due to weak proxies and lack of direct evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=9.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.62 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude ('It is important to be well insured for everything'). The only quantitative evidence available is for a different attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', 13%), which is a weak proxy for risk-aversion or cautiousness but not directly about insurance. Other evidence (e.g., planning grocery shopping) suggests some forward-planning but is only weakly related to insurance attitudes. There is no direct evidence for insurance attitudes in this segment. According to the evidence hierarchy, the closest quantitative proxy (fuel consumption) is weighted at 50% relevance, and qualitative evidence at 20%. Both suggest a cautious but not strongly risk-averse mindset. Therefore, I start from the attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%) and adjust slightly downward for agreement (to 32% total agree) due to the low proxy values and lack of direct evidence. The distribution is slightly more neutral and disagreeing than the baseline, reflecting uncertainty and the weak relevance of the proxies. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct evidence and the weak correlation of proxies.
Run 3: Strongly agree=9.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=21.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.62 / Rationale: Concept type is 'Attitude', so the baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence for insurance attitudes in this segment. The closest quantitative proxy is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.13), which is a weak indicator of risk-aversion or cautiousness, but not directly about insurance. Other proxies (adverts, mass market shopping) are not relevant to insurance attitudes. The qualitative note about planning and weekly shopping suggests some forward-thinking, but this is only weakly related to insurance mindset. Given the lack of direct evidence and only weakly relevant proxies, I remain close to the attitude baseline, making only a slight downward adjustment to agreement (SA/A) to reflect the low value of the risk-aversion proxy (0.13) and the absence of strong evidence for high insurance concern. The estimate is therefore conservative, with a slight tilt toward neutrality and disagreement. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct evidence and weak proxies.
Run 4: Strongly agree=9.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=21.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.62 / Rationale: Concept type is Attitude (importance of being well insured). The only quantitative evidence is for 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (13%), which is a weak proxy for risk-aversion or cautiousness, but not directly about insurance. Other proxies (adverts, shopping habits) are even less relevant. The qualitative note about planning and weekly shopping suggests some forward-thinking, but does not clearly indicate a strong insurance mindset. Given the lack of direct evidence, I rely primarily on the Attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%), with a slight nudge toward neutrality and disagreement due to the low agreement in the closest proxy (fuel consumption importance). Demographic calibrations are not applied due to lack of clear directionality. Confidence is moderate due to weak and indirect evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=9.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=21.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.62 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('It is important to be well insured for everything'). The only quantitative evidence available is for a different attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', 13%), which is a weak proxy for risk-aversion or cautiousness but not directly related to insurance attitudes. Other evidence (e.g., planning shopping weekly) suggests some tendency toward planning but is only weakly relevant to insurance. Given the lack of direct evidence, I rely primarily on the attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%) and make a slight downward adjustment to agreement (SA 9%, A 25%) to reflect the low proxy value for risk-aversion and the absence of strong evidence for high insurance concern. The qualitative note about planning is not strong enough to warrant an upward adjustment. The estimate is therefore conservative, with a slightly higher neutral and disagreement share, and confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct evidence.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.80
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale correctly distinguishes between dietary behaviors (vegan, vegetarian, meat-eating rates) and attitudes, noting that endorsement of healthy eating as a value is typically higher than actual adoption of restrictive diets. The use of the attitude baseline is appropriate in the absence of direct attitudinal data, and the qualitative notes do not provide strong evidence to warrant deviation from this baseline. The confidence level is appropriately moderate-high, reflecting the strong behavioral evidence but lack of direct attitude measurement. No major corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude' (Healthy Eating), so the baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The direct quantitative evidence shows very low vegan/vegetarian rates (1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, 18% pescatarian/flexitarian/other), and a high rate of meat-eating (76%). However, these are behaviors, not attitudes, and healthy eating as an attitude is typically more widely endorsed than restrictive dietary behaviors. The qualitative notes (outdoor pursuits, pets, eating out) suggest a moderately active lifestyle but do not strongly indicate a health-focused attitude. No strong demographic cues are present to warrant calibration. Therefore, the attitude baseline is most appropriate, with no major adjustments. Confidence is high due to strong evidence alignment with the baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is 'Healthy Eating', which is classified as an attitude (opinion about a desirable behavior, not a direct behavior or identity statement). The direct quantitative evidence shows that only a small proportion are vegan (1%) or vegetarian (4%), with the vast majority eating meat (76%) and a moderate segment in pescatarian/flexitarian/other (18%). This suggests that while actual high-friction dietary change is rare, it does not directly measure attitudes toward healthy eating, which tend to be more positive than actual behavior. The concept type baseline for attitudes is used (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). No strong demographic or qualitative evidence suggests deviation from this baseline. The qualitative notes (outdoor pursuits, pets, eating out) suggest a moderately active lifestyle but do not strongly indicate above-average health attitudes. Therefore, the baseline attitude template is most appropriate, with moderate confidence due to lack of direct attitudinal data.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is 'Healthy Eating', which is classified as an attitude (opinion about a desirable behavior, not a direct behavior or identity statement). The direct quantitative evidence shows very low rates of vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) diets, with a large majority eating meat (76%) and a moderate minority in pescatarian/flexitarian/other (18%). However, these are behaviors, not attitudes, and do not directly measure agreement with healthy eating as a value. The qualitative notes suggest some interest in outdoor and active lifestyles, which may correlate weakly with valuing healthy eating, but this is not strong evidence. Given the lack of direct attitude data, the attitude baseline is used: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. No strong demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence provided. Confidence is moderate-high due to the lack of direct attitude data but strong behavioral evidence suggesting healthy eating is not a dominant behavior.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is 'Healthy Eating', which is an attitude (opinion about a positive lifestyle behavior). The direct quantitative evidence shows very low rates of vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) diets, with a large majority eating meat (76%) and a moderate minority in pescatarian/flexitarian/other (18%). However, these are behaviors, not attitudes. The attitude toward healthy eating is likely higher than the actual adoption of restrictive diets. The qualitative notes (outdoor pursuits, cycling, pets, eating out) suggest some health-consciousness but not a dominant health-obsessed culture. No strong demographic cues to shift the baseline. Therefore, I use the attitude baseline template (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%), as there is no direct attitude data and the behavioral data suggests only a minority take high-friction healthy eating actions. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong behavioral evidence but lack of direct attitude measurement.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is 'Healthy Eating', which is classified as an attitude (opinion about a positive lifestyle choice). The direct quantitative evidence shows very low rates of vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) behaviors, with a high proportion eating meat (76%) and a moderate share in pescatarian/flexitarian/other (18%). However, these are behaviors, not attitudes, and healthy eating as an attitude is typically much more widely endorsed than actual dietary change. There is no direct attitude data, so the attitude baseline template is used (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). Demographic or qualitative notes (outdoor pursuits, eating out, pets) do not strongly shift the baseline, as they suggest a mix of lifestyle interests but not a strong health focus. No evidence justifies a major upward or downward adjustment. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong behavioral evidence but lack of direct attitude data.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.79
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The runs consistently reference the most relevant quantitative proxies (especially 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' at 0.15, and other attitude proxies in the 0.28-0.34 range), and correctly note that these are behaviors or related attitudes rather than direct measures of the target concept. The demographic adjustment (+3pp for above average income/home ownership) is applied consistently and appropriately. The rationale for not pushing agreement higher is well-founded, given the moderate to low levels of proactive financial attitudes in the evidence. The qualitative context is used to calibrate, not override, the quantitative evidence. Confidence is moderate-high due to the alignment of evidence and the transparent, stepwise reasoning. No major revisions are needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 15.40%
  Slightly agree: 27.60%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.60%
  Slightly disagree: 17.40%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=16.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is Attitude (opinion about responsibility for retirement security). The most relevant direct quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (0.15), which is low, but this is a behavior, not an attitude. Other attitudes (e.g., 'I only save for a specific purpose' at 0.28, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 0.34) are also low, suggesting a moderate to low sense of financial agency or proactivity in this segment. The qualitative profile describes home-owning families/couples with above average incomes, which would slightly increase agreement due to higher income (+3pp). Baseline for Attitude is: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the above average income and home ownership, I increase agreement by 3pp (to 13% SA, 30% A), but the low behavioral evidence suggests not to push agreement too high. Final estimate: SA 16%, A 27%, N 28%, D 17%, SD 12%. Confidence is moderate-high due to multiple relevant quantitative inputs and clear demographic profile.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Concept type is Attitude (about responsibility for retirement security). Baseline for attitudes is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. Direct quantitative evidence is limited: the closest proxy ('Plans to use other investments for retirement', 0.15) suggests low proactive planning, but this is a behavior, not an attitude. Other attitude proxies ('I only save for a specific purpose', 0.28; 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort', 0.34) are also low, indicating moderate to low financial engagement. However, the target statement is about personal responsibility, which tends to elicit higher agreement than specific behaviors. The segment is home-owning, above-average income, which warrants a +3pp agreement calibration. Therefore, I slightly increase agreement from the attitude baseline, but not to identity levels. Final distribution reflects moderate agreement, with a slight skew toward agreement due to demographic and the nature of the statement (responsibility).
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'). The concept type baseline for attitudes is: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The most relevant direct quantitative evidence ("Plans to use other investments for retirement" at 15%) suggests relatively low proactive planning, but this is not a direct attitude match. Other attitude proxies ("I only save for a specific purpose" at 28%, "Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort" at 34%) indicate moderate agreement with financial self-management, but not strongly so. The qualitative profile describes above-average income, home-owning families/couples, which warrants a +3pp agreement calibration (high income). Applying this to the baseline, and considering the evidence does not show strong deviation from the norm, I slightly increase agreement: SA 13%, A 27%, N 28%, D 18%, SD 14%. Confidence is moderate-high due to the alignment of evidence and demographic calibration.
Run 4: Strongly agree=17.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Concept type is Attitude (about responsibility for retirement security). The most relevant direct quantitative evidence is low agreement with 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (15%), but this is a behavior/plan, not an attitude, and is low friction. Other attitude proxies ('I only save for a specific purpose' at 28%, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 34%) suggest moderate agreement with proactive financial attitudes, but not specifically about responsibility. The qualitative profile describes above average income, home-owning families/couples, which warrants a +3pp agreement calibration (high income). Baseline for Attitude is 37% agreement (SA+A). Given the segment's above average income and home ownership, a modest upward adjustment is justified, but the direct evidence is weak and not directly about responsibility. Therefore, I estimate agreement at 45% (SA 17%, A 28%), with the rest distributed per baseline. Confidence is moderate-high due to reasonable demographic fit but lack of direct attitude evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'). The concept type baseline for attitudes is: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. 

Direct quantitative evidence is limited: the closest relevant item is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (value=0.15, relevance=0.98), which is a behavior proxy and suggests low proactive planning for retirement. Other attitude proxies ('I only save for a specific purpose' at 0.28, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 0.34) indicate moderate to low agreement with proactive or self-reliant financial attitudes. The highest agreement is with 'I trust financial price comparison sites' (0.52), but this is less directly related.

Demographically, the segment is home-owning families/couples with above average incomes, which would normally add +3pp to agreement (high income calibration). However, the direct evidence suggests only moderate agreement with self-reliant financial attitudes.

Given the evidence, I start with the attitude baseline and slightly increase agreement (SA/A) by 2-3pp to reflect the above average income and home ownership, but not dramatically, as the direct evidence does not show strong self-reliance. The final distribution is: SA 13%, A 28%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 14%. Confidence is moderate-high due to the relevance of the proxies and clear demographic profile.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.81
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently applies the attitude baseline and makes a modest, evidence-based upward adjustment for above-average income and home ownership, which are both relevant to the concept. The quantitative evidence (high utility outgoings, moderate sporting event attendance) and qualitative profile (home-owning, above-average income) are appropriately used to justify a small increase in agreement. The lack of direct attitudinal or behavioral data about switching is acknowledged, and the adjustments are kept conservative. The confidence is high due to the strong relevance and clarity of the demographic and expenditure data, and the reasoning is transparent and methodologically sound.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 11.60%
  Slightly agree: 28.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 27.80%
  Slightly disagree: 19.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.40%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the attitude baseline applies (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). Quantitative evidence shows this segment is home-owning, above-average income, and pays significant outgoings for utilities, suggesting some awareness and incentive to consider switching. However, only about 20% visit sporting events (proxy for engagement/initiative) and only 9% visit places of worship (low community embeddedness), so no strong evidence of high friction behavior. Demographically, above-average income gives a +3pp to agreement. Applying this to the attitude baseline, I slightly increase agreement (SA/A) and decrease disagreement. The final distribution is close to baseline but slightly more positive due to income. Confidence is high due to strong relevance of quantitative and qualitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'). The baseline for attitudes is: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The segment is 'home owning families and couples with above average incomes,' which suggests a slight increase in agreement (+3pp) due to higher income and home ownership (more likely to engage with utilities and see value in switching). Quantitative evidence is indirect: 20% visit sporting events (suggests moderate engagement with activities), and high outgoings on utilities (suggests awareness of utility costs). However, there is no direct evidence of high friction behavior or strong attitudes toward switching. Therefore, I apply the attitude baseline, slightly increasing agreement (SA +2pp, A +1pp, D -1pp, SD -2pp) to reflect the segment's higher income and engagement. The distribution remains close to the attitude baseline, with a modest tilt toward agreement. Confidence is high due to clear segment and strong concept type match.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'). The concept type baseline for attitudes is: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The segment is 'home owning families and couples with above average incomes,' which suggests a slight increase in agreement (+3pp) due to higher income and home ownership (more likely to engage with utilities and see value in switching). Quantitative evidence is limited but relevant: the group spends significantly on utilities, indicating awareness of utility costs, and about 20% attend sporting events (suggesting moderate engagement in out-of-home activities, possibly correlating with openness to change). No direct evidence on attitudes toward switching, so the baseline is only slightly adjusted upward for income. Final distribution: SA 12%, A 28%, N 28%, D 19%, SD 13%. Confidence is moderately high due to strong demographic fit but lack of direct attitudinal data.
Run 4: Strongly agree=11.00%, Slightly agree=29.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the attitude baseline applies (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). Quantitative evidence shows this segment visits sporting events (20%) and places of worship (9%), suggesting moderate engagement in community activities but not extreme. The segment is described as home-owning families/couples with above average incomes, which warrants a +3pp agreement adjustment (high income). No direct evidence about attitudes to switching, so the baseline is only slightly adjusted. Final distribution: SA 11%, A 29%, N 28%, D 19%, SD 13%. Confidence is high due to strong demographic clarity and concept type fit.
Run 5: Strongly agree=11.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the attitude baseline applies: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The segment is 'home owning families and couples with above average incomes,' which warrants a +3pp agreement adjustment for high income. However, the direct quantitative evidence is limited: only 19.6% visit sporting events (proxy for willingness to engage in effortful activities), and outgoings on utilities are high, suggesting awareness of utility costs but not necessarily high motivation to switch. There is no direct evidence of high friction behavior (actual switching), so the attitude baseline is most appropriate, with a slight upward calibration for income. The final distribution is: SA 11%, A 28%, N 28%, D 19%, SD 14%. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong concept type match and reasonable demographic calibration, but limited direct evidence.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The runs consistently reference direct quantitative evidence (online purchase rates by category) and qualitative context (moderate internet usage) to calibrate the predicted attitude distribution. The rationale for each run is clear: lower online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks, pet care) are interpreted as a proxy for higher cash preference, while higher online rates for less frequent, higher-ticket items (home appliances, travel) are acknowledged but do not dominate the estimate. The adjustment from the baseline is modest and well-explained, reflecting the mixed digital engagement of the segment. The evidence selection is balanced and relevant, and the confidence in the estimate is appropriately high given the strength and directness of the evidence. No corrective action is needed.

Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=21.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is Attitude (preference for cash use). Direct quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for this segment (20% for alcoholic drinks, 22% for pet care, moderate for home appliances at 51%, and 59% for travel), indicating a below-average propensity for digital payments and a likely higher preference for cash. Qualitative notes describe internet usage as 'moderate,' supporting the idea that this group is not highly digital. Starting from the attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%), I shift slightly toward agreement (higher SA/A) to reflect the segment's lower online purchase rates, but not dramatically, as home appliances and travel are more digital. The distribution reflects a modest tilt toward cash preference, but still substantial neutrality and disagreement, as cash use is declining overall. Confidence is high due to strong direct evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=21.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude (preference for cash). Direct quantitative evidence shows relatively low rates of online purchasing for this segment (20% for alcoholic drinks, 22% for pet care, moderate for home appliances at 51%, and higher for holiday/travel at 59%). The most relevant categories (alcoholic drinks, pet care) are low, suggesting a moderate to high preference for offline (potentially cash) purchases. Qualitative notes indicate 'moderate' internet usage, supporting the idea that this group is not strongly digital-first. Applying the attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%) but shifting slightly toward agreement (higher cash preference) due to low online purchase rates. Adjusted to SA 13%, A 24%, N 26%, D 21%, SD 16%. Confidence is high due to strong direct evidence and clear demographic fit.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). The direct quantitative evidence shows low rates of online purchasing for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 20%, pet care 22%), with higher rates for home appliances (51%) and holiday/travel (59%). This suggests that for routine, lower-ticket items, this segment is less likely to use online/digital payments, implying a relative preference for cash or in-person transactions. Qualitative notes describe their internet usage as 'moderate,' supporting the idea that they are not heavy digital adopters. Applying the attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%) and calibrating slightly upward for agreement (since evidence suggests a modest preference for cash over digital for most purchases), I increased 'strongly agree' and 'slightly agree' by a few points. The distribution remains centered around neutral, reflecting that while there is some preference for cash, it is not overwhelming. Confidence is high due to strong direct evidence and clear qualitative support.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude (preference for cash). Direct quantitative evidence shows low rates of online purchasing for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 20%, pet care 22%), suggesting a relatively high preference for offline/cash transactions in this segment. Moderate internet usage (qualitative) supports this. However, higher online rates for home appliances (51%) and holiday/travel (59%) indicate some digital engagement for larger purchases, but these are less frequent. Weighted average of online purchase rates across categories is low (~28%), so preference for cash is likely above the general attitude baseline (37% agreement). Adjusted upward for this segment's moderate digital adoption. Final estimate: agreement (SA+A) at 36%, slightly above baseline, with a broad neutral/disagree spread reflecting mixed behaviors.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude (preference for cash usage). Direct quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for this segment (20-22% for everyday categories, up to 51-59% for higher-ticket items), suggesting a moderate to above-average preference for offline/cash transactions. Qualitative notes indicate 'moderate' internet usage, reinforcing that this group is not highly digital. Starting from the attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%), I slightly increase agreement (SA/A) to reflect the segment's lower online purchase rates, but not dramatically, as some online activity is present. The distribution remains close to the attitude baseline, with a small upward nudge for agreement. Confidence is high due to strong direct evidence.
