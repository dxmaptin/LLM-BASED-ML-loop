### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 2
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the evidence hierarchy, giving primary weight to direct, high-relevance quantitative data (11% manage by phone, 2.6% arrange by phone) to cap agreement rates. The distribution of neutrality and disagreement is reasonable, with a slight tilt toward disagreement reflecting the low behavioral prevalence and likely attitudes. The approach is methodologically sound, directly addresses prior critic feedback, and does not overstate agreement. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 2.00%
  Slightly agree: 9.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 32.40%
  Slightly disagree: 33.80%
  Strongly disagree: 22.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=2.00%, Slightly agree=9.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=34.00%, Slightly disagree=33.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The most relevant quantitative evidence shows that only 11% manage their current account by phone and just 2.6% arrange it by phone. This is direct, high-relevance evidence that agreement with a statement about managing or arranging accounts by phone is very low. Therefore, agreement (SA + A) should be capped at about 11%. The remainder is distributed among neutrality and disagreement, with a slight tilt toward disagreement due to the low prevalence and likely negative attitudes toward phone-based account management. This overrides the generic attitude baseline. The estimate is thus: SA 2%, A 9%, N 34%, D 33%, SD 22%. Confidence is high due to the direct quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=2.00%, Slightly agree=9.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=34.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The most relevant quantitative evidence shows that only 11% manage their current account by phone and just 2.6% arrange it by phone. These are direct behavioral indicators and should strongly anchor the agreement rates for any attitude statement about managing or arranging accounts by phone. According to the evidence hierarchy, direct quantitative evidence (relevance >0.8) overrides the generic attitude baseline. Therefore, agreement (SA+A) should be capped at ~11%. The remainder is distributed among neutrality and disagreement, with a slight tilt toward disagreement given the low prevalence and likely negative attitudes toward phone-based account management. This approach directly addresses the critic feedback and aligns with the evidence weighting rules.
Run 3: Strongly agree=2.00%, Slightly agree=9.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=34.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The most relevant quantitative evidence shows that only 11% manage their current account by phone and just 2.6% arrange it by phone. This is direct, high-relevance evidence about actual behavior, which should strongly constrain the agreement rates for any attitude statement about managing/arranging accounts by phone. According to the evidence hierarchy, direct quantitative evidence (relevance >0.8) overrides the generic attitude baseline. Therefore, agreement (SA+A) should be capped at about 11%. The remainder is distributed among neutrality and disagreement, with a slight tilt toward disagreement due to the low prevalence and the likelihood that most people do not prefer or endorse this method. This approach directly addresses the critic feedback and aligns with the evidence weighting rules.
Run 4: Strongly agree=2.00%, Slightly agree=9.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=34.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The most relevant quantitative evidence shows that only 11% manage their current account by phone and just 2.6% arrange it by phone. These are direct behavioral indicators and should strongly anchor the agreement rates for any attitude statement about managing or arranging accounts by phone. Therefore, agreement (SA+A) should not exceed 11%. The remainder is distributed between neutrality and disagreement, with a slight tilt toward disagreement due to the low prevalence and likely negative attitudes toward phone-based account management. This approach follows the evidence hierarchy, giving 80% weight to direct quantitative data, and aligns with the critic feedback to avoid overestimating agreement.
Run 5: Strongly agree=2.00%, Slightly agree=9.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=34.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The most relevant quantitative evidence shows that only 11% manage their current account by phone and just 2.6% arrange it by phone. This is direct, high-relevance quantitative evidence about actual behavior, which should strongly constrain the agreement rates for any attitude statement about managing or arranging accounts by phone. According to the evidence hierarchy, direct quantitative evidence (relevance 0.79–0.80) should override the generic attitude baseline. Therefore, agreement (SA + A) should be capped at about 11%. The remainder is distributed among neutrality and disagreement, with a moderate skew toward disagreement, reflecting the low prevalence and likely negative or indifferent attitudes toward this channel. This approach directly addresses the critic feedback and aligns with the evidence weighting principles.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence (notably, the very low rate of self-identified environmentalists at 7.6% and moderate skepticism toward energy companies at 27%), as well as the qualitative note about reluctance to pay extra for environmentally friendly options. The semantic category ('Environmental Virtue Signaling') is appropriately applied, and the topline estimate is kept close to the baseline, with a slight nudge toward neutrality/disagreement in line with the evidence. The repeated, consistent logic across runs, and the explicit weighting of direct evidence, support a high-confidence assessment that the estimate is well-grounded in the provided data. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). Quantitative evidence shows only 8% consider themselves environmentalists and 27% think energy companies don't care about the environment, both indicating low environmental identification and skepticism. Qualitative notes reinforce that while there is some concern, it does not translate into willingness to pay or strong attitudes. No evidence suggests higher agreement than the category baseline. Therefore, the baseline is maintained, with a slight nudge toward more neutrality/disagreement due to the low environmentalist self-ID. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). Quantitative evidence shows only 8% consider themselves environmentalists and 27% are skeptical of energy companies' environmental care, both indicating low environmental identification and skepticism. Qualitative notes reinforce that while there is some care for the environment, there is a strong reluctance to pay extra or make sacrifices for environmental reasons. No evidence suggests higher agreement than the baseline, so the category baseline is maintained. No demographic calibration is needed as the evidence is highly relevant and specific to this segment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). Quantitative evidence shows only 8% consider themselves environmentalists and 27% are skeptical of energy companies' environmental care, both indicating low environmental identification and moderate skepticism. Qualitative notes reinforce that while there is some care for the environment, there is reluctance to pay extra for environmentally friendly options, suggesting attitudes are not strongly held. No evidence suggests this segment is more progressive or urban than average, so no demographic calibration is applied. The evidence supports sticking close to the category baseline, with high neutrality and significant disagreement due to cost/effort aversion and weak environmental identity.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: This concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), so it fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). The quantitative evidence is highly relevant: only 7.6% consider themselves environmentalists, and qualitative notes indicate that while there is some care for the environment, there is a strong reluctance to pay extra for environmentally friendly options. This supports a low level of strong agreement and a high neutral/disagree proportion. The evidence is consistent with the category baseline, so no upward adjustment is warranted. Demographic calibrations (for 'aspiring communities') do not suggest a significant deviation from the baseline. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between category and evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior or purchase), so it fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA+A). The strongest quantitative evidence is 'I consider myself an environmentalist' at 8% (very low) and 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' at 27% (low-moderate). The qualitative note says they care about the environment but won't pay extra, confirming the attitude-behavior gap. The evidence is highly relevant and suggests even lower agreement than the category baseline, so I weight the direct evidence (especially the 8% 'environmentalist' self-ID) at 80%, pulling the estimate down. The final estimate is slightly below the category baseline, with 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neutral, 25% slightly disagree, and 15% strongly disagree. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently and appropriately links the high proportion of outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels (79.45%) to the salience of cost-saving behaviors in this segment. The qualitative evidence about planning and weekly grocery shopping further supports the inference of a cost-conscious, organized mindset. The semantic category baseline is clearly stated and the slight upward adjustment is well reasoned. There is no contradictory evidence, and the evidence selection is balanced and relevant. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 32.00%
  Slightly agree: 39.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 14.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving on utilities is a universal, low-effort, money-saving behavior. The quantitative evidence shows that 79.45% of this segment's outgoings are on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels, indicating high salience of these costs and likely motivation to reduce them. Qualitative notes about planning and weekly grocery shopping further support a cost-conscious, organized mindset. No evidence suggests lower-than-baseline agreement. Therefore, the estimate is slightly above the category baseline (SA 30%, A 40%), reflecting the segment's high cost awareness and planning. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving on utilities is a universal, low-effort, money-saving action. The quantitative evidence shows that this segment has very high outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, etc. (79.45), which increases the salience of cost-saving behaviors. Qualitative notes indicate planning and weekly grocery shopping, reinforcing a cost-conscious, organized mindset. No evidence suggests lower agreement. Therefore, the estimate is slightly above the category baseline, with a small increase in 'strongly agree' due to the segment's high utility costs and planning behaviors. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving on utility bills is a universal, low-effort, money-saving action. The quantitative evidence shows that this segment has very high outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels (79.45), which increases the salience of cost-saving behaviors. Qualitative notes indicate planning and weekly grocery shopping, reinforcing a pattern of proactive, cost-conscious behavior. There is no evidence of digital confusion or disengagement that would reduce agreement. Therefore, the estimate is slightly above the category baseline (71%), with a small upward calibration for this segment's high utility costs and planning tendencies. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cost-Consciousness Behaviors. The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is a classic cost-saving, low-effort behavior, which typically sees high agreement (baseline: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%). The strongest quantitative evidence is the very high outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels (79.45%), indicating this is a salient expense and likely a focus for savings. Qualitative notes about planning and weekly shopping reinforce a cost-conscious, organized mindset. No evidence suggests lower agreement. Demographic calibrations are not needed as this segment is not specified as high/low income or elderly. Final estimate is very close to the category baseline, with slight upward adjustment for strong cost salience. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is a classic example of a cost-consciousness behavior: it saves money with minimal effort and is universally relevant, especially in the context of high outgoings on housing, water, electricity, and gas (quantitative evidence: 79.45% of outgoings). The baseline for this semantic category is high (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%). There is no direct quantitative evidence for this specific attitude, but the segment is described as planning in advance and shopping weekly, which aligns with cost-conscious, effortful behaviors. No evidence suggests lower agreement. Demographic calibrations are not needed as the segment is not specified as high/low income or elderly. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The runs consistently reference the most relevant quantitative evidence ('Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions', value=0.39) and appropriately note its relatedness but non-identity to the target concept (fuel consumption as the most important feature). The qualitative evidence is also correctly interpreted: while there is environmental concern, it does not translate into willingness to pay extra, which aligns with a moderate but not high prioritization of fuel consumption. The baseline for the semantic category is correctly cited, and the adjustment upwards is reasonable but not excessive, given the 'most important' framing. The rationale for the distribution (minority agreement, large neutral/disagree group) is well-supported by the evidence. Confidence is high due to the clear chain of reasoning and strong evidence fit.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 6.80%
  Slightly agree: 15.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 27.40%
  Slightly disagree: 29.20%
  Strongly disagree: 21.60%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=21.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, as it refers to a high-cost decision and prioritization among features. The closest quantitative evidence is the 0.39 agreement for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' as an important car feature, which is related but not identical—environmental concern is generally lower than cost concern, but both are not top priorities for this segment. Qualitative evidence states that people care about the environment but won't pay extra, suggesting cost is a concern but not the overriding one. The baseline for 'Expensive Purchases' is low (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). Given the slightly higher agreement for environmental features (0.39), I nudge agreement up a few points, but not dramatically, since 'most important' is a high bar and this segment is price-sensitive but not single-mindedly so. The distribution reflects a minority agreeing, a large neutral/disagree group, and a notable strongly disagree contingent. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear semantic fit.
Run 2: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which typically has low agreement (~15%) because it requires prioritizing a specific, cost-related feature over others in a high-cost context. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.39), which is higher than the baseline for this category but still below 50%. However, this item is about environmental friendliness, not directly about fuel consumption, though there is some overlap. Qualitative evidence indicates that while the segment cares about the environment, they are not willing to pay extra for it, suggesting that cost (fuel consumption) may be somewhat more important than environmental features, but still not the top priority for most. Other evidence (insurance, pet care research) is less relevant. Given this, I weight the agreement slightly higher than the baseline for 'Expensive Purchases' (15%), but not as high as the environmental attitude (39%), settling at around 20% agreement. The distribution reflects a large share of neutrality or disagreement, consistent with the evidence and category pattern.
Run 3: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, as it refers to a high-cost decision and prioritization of a specific feature. The closest quantitative evidence is the 0.39 agreement for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' as an important car feature, which is related but not identical—environmental concern is typically lower than cost concern, but both are secondary to price, reliability, and brand for most buyers. Qualitative evidence indicates that while the segment cares about the environment, they are unwilling to pay extra for it, suggesting cost is a concern but not the overriding one. The baseline for this category is low (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%), and the evidence (0.39 for environmental friendliness) is slightly higher but still below 50%, and not directly about fuel consumption. Given that fuel consumption is a cost-saving feature, but the question asks if it is the 'most important' (a strong claim), agreement will be low. Adjusting slightly upward from baseline due to the related evidence, but not dramatically, as the 'most important' framing is restrictive. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' is about prioritizing a single (cost-related) feature in a high-cost purchase context. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (0.39), which is somewhat related but not identical—environmental concern is generally lower than cost concern, but both are secondary to price, reliability, and brand for most buyers. Qualitative evidence indicates that while people care about the environment, they are unwilling to pay extra for it, suggesting cost is a concern but not the overriding one. The baseline for Expensive Purchases is low (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%), but the evidence for environmental features being important is slightly higher (0.39), so I modestly increase agreement, but not above 25%. Most people consider fuel consumption important, but not the most important feature—price, reliability, and brand often rank higher. Therefore, agreement is slightly higher than the baseline for expensive purchases, but still low overall. Confidence is high due to strong evidence and clear category fit.
Run 5: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' is about prioritizing a specific (cost-related) feature in a high-cost purchase context. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (0.39), which is a related but not identical concept—environmental concern is typically lower than cost concern, but both are secondary to price, reliability, or brand for most buyers. Qualitative evidence indicates that while people care about the environment, they are unwilling to pay extra for it, suggesting cost is a concern but not the overriding one. The baseline for Expensive Purchases is low (SA 3%, A 12%), but since fuel consumption is a cost-saving feature (though not as universal as general cost-consciousness), I adjust upward slightly, but not to the 70% cost-consciousness level, because the context is a major purchase where multiple factors compete. The distribution reflects that only a minority will prioritize fuel consumption above all else, with most either neutral or disagreeing. Confidence is high due to strong relevance of the car purchase evidence and qualitative notes.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative indicator ('I do not mind taking risks with my money' at 20% agreement), which supports the use of the debt/risk aversion baseline. The qualitative note about planning and weekly shopping further supports a cautious, risk-averse profile, though not strongly enough to warrant deviation from the baseline. The repeated rationale across runs demonstrates a stable, evidence-based approach, and there is no indication from the evidence that this segment is significantly more or less debt-averse than the baseline. The confidence is appropriately high due to the direct relevance of the quantitative evidence and the semantic fit of the category. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 12.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA+A). The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' at 20% agreement, suggesting this segment is somewhat less risk-averse than average. No direct evidence on debt aversion, but the low risk-taking and low community engagement (helping out in the community = 10%) suggest a cautious, possibly less socially-oriented group. The qualitative note about planning and shopping weekly hints at some prudence, but not strongly. Therefore, I use the category baseline (SA 18%, A 25%, N 25%, D 20%, SD 12%) with no major demographic calibration, as the evidence does not indicate a strong deviation from the norm. Confidence is high due to the close match of the evidence to the category.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 20% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting most are risk-averse), and only 10% are involved in community helping (suggesting a more cautious, less outgoing profile). The segment is described as planning in advance, which aligns with risk aversion and debt avoidance. No evidence suggests unusually high or low debt aversion for this group, so the category baseline is appropriate. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated by the evidence. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' falls under the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~43% (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 20% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting risk aversion is common), and the segment shows low agreement with community engagement and climate concern, indicating a generally cautious, non-risk-seeking profile. No evidence suggests unusually high or low debt aversion for this segment, so the category baseline is appropriate. Demographic or qualitative hints (planning, weekly shopping) reinforce a cautious, planned approach but do not strongly shift the baseline. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative support for risk aversion.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 20% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting moderate risk aversion), and only 10% participate in community helping (suggesting low pro-social engagement, but not directly relevant). The segment is described as planning in advance, which aligns with cautious, risk-averse behaviors, but the evidence is not strong enough to push the estimate much higher. No strong demographic calibrations apply. The distribution reflects the category baseline, with minor adjustment for the segment's moderate risk aversion. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~43% (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 20% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting risk aversion is somewhat common but not dominant), and only 10% report 'helping out in the community' as an interest (suggesting a more self-reliant, cautious profile). The segment is described as planning-oriented, which aligns with risk aversion. No evidence suggests unusually high or low debt aversion, so the category baseline is appropriate. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative support and strong category fit.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category baseline, which is appropriate given the nature of the statement ('I am very good at managing money') and the typical social desirability bias associated with such self-assessments. The quantitative evidence (e.g., 29% manage savings online, high private car ownership) is relevant and supports the assumption of moderate financial engagement, without indicating any need to adjust the baseline up or down. There is no contradictory evidence, and the qualitative context does not suggest a need for demographic or attitudinal recalibration. The confidence in the estimate is high due to the strong semantic fit and the absence of conflicting data. No corrective action is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 8.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a positive self-assessment of competence, and such statements are subject to social desirability bias. The quantitative evidence provided does not directly measure self-assessed money management skill, but related indicators (e.g., 29% manage savings online, high private car ownership) suggest moderate financial engagement and capability. No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the category baseline. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated by the evidence, so the baseline is used. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.

  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a positive self-assessment of competence, and such statements are generally inflated by social desirability bias. The quantitative evidence provided does not directly measure self-assessed money management skill, but related data (e.g., 29% manage savings online, high private car ownership) suggest moderate financial engagement and some digital literacy, which is consistent with moderate-to-high self-confidence in money management. No evidence suggests a need to adjust the baseline downward. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated by the evidence, so the baseline is used. Confidence is high due to strong semantic fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees high agreement (baseline: 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 20% neither, 12% slightly disagree, 8% strongly disagree). This is due to social desirability and positive self-concept bias—most people like to see themselves as competent with money. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 29% manage savings online, high private car ownership, moderate spending on miscellaneous goods) does not directly contradict this baseline and suggests a segment with moderate financial engagement and self-confidence. No evidence suggests a need to adjust the baseline. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of conflicting evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a positive self-concept statement, and such items are subject to social desirability bias—people tend to rate themselves as competent in managing money. The quantitative evidence does not directly measure self-assessed money management skill, but related indicators (e.g., 29% manage savings online, high private car ownership) suggest moderate financial engagement and responsibility. No evidence suggests this segment is unusually poor or excellent at money management, so the baseline applies. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated by the evidence provided. Thus, the baseline for 'Self-Reliance Identity' is used: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of conflicting evidence.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently anchors the prediction to the most relevant quantitative evidence ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', value=0.13, relevance=0.98), which is a strong proxy for risk-averse, high-cost attitudes. The qualitative note about planning and weekly shopping is appropriately considered as a minor upward nudge, but not enough to override the low baseline for expensive commitments. The other quantitative evidence is correctly deprioritized due to lower relevance. The repeated, consistent rationale across runs demonstrates a robust methodological approach, and the confidence in the estimate is warranted given the strong alignment with the available evidence.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 4.00%
  Slightly agree: 13.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 23.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') fits the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) due to the high cost and non-universality of comprehensive insurance. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.13, relevance=0.98), which is similarly a high-cost, risk-averse attitude and shows very low agreement (13%). Other evidence (adverts for cinema/soft drinks, mass market clothing) is less relevant but suggests this segment is not highly focused on premium or risk-averse features. The qualitative note about planning and weekly grocery shopping suggests some organization but does not override the low baseline for expensive commitments. Therefore, the estimate is anchored to the category baseline (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%), with minor calibration for the segment's moderate planning tendency. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') fits the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) due to the cost barrier and the fact that comprehensive insurance is not a universal priority. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.13), which is a similar high-cost, risk-averse attitude and shows very low agreement (13%). Other evidence (adverts for cinema/soft drinks, mass market clothing) is less relevant but suggests mainstream, price-sensitive attitudes, not premium or risk-averse. The qualitative note about planning and weekly grocery shopping suggests some organization but does not override the low baseline for expensive commitments. Therefore, the estimate is anchored at the category baseline (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%), with a slight upward nudge for the segment's planning tendency (+1pp to SA/A), but the strong quantitative evidence (13% agreement on a similar item) keeps the estimate low. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') fits the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) due to the cost barrier and lack of universal priority. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.13, relevance=0.98), which is a similar high-cost, risk-mitigation attitude and supports the low baseline. Other evidence (adverts, mass market clothing) is less relevant. The qualitative note about planning and weekly shopping suggests some conscientiousness, but does not override the low baseline for expensive, comprehensive insurance. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline, with a slight nudge toward agreement due to the segment's planning tendency, but not enough to shift it out of the low-agreement range.
Run 4: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') fits the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) due to the cost barrier and lack of universal priority. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.13), which is very similar in structure (prioritizing a costly, risk-mitigating feature) and supports the low baseline. Other evidence (adverts, mass market clothing) is less relevant. The qualitative note about planning and weekly grocery shopping suggests some conscientiousness, but not enough to shift the baseline. No strong demographic calibration applies. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline, with a slight nudge toward agreement due to the segment's planning tendency, but not enough to move it out of the low-agreement range. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative match.
Run 5: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) due to the high cost and non-universality of comprehensive insurance. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.13, relevance=0.98), which is similarly a high-cost, risk-averse attitude and shows only 13% agreement. Other evidence (adverts, mass market clothing) is less relevant. The qualitative note about planning and weekly shopping suggests some conscientiousness, but does not override the low baseline for expensive commitments. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%), slightly nudged up for the segment's planning tendency (+1pp to agree). Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' is sufficiently justified based on the evidence provided. The quantitative toplines clearly show a low prevalence of vegan and vegetarian diets (1% and 4%, respectively), with a strong majority eating meat (76%) and a moderate minority in pescatarian/flexitarian/other categories (18%). This supports the conclusion that actual dietary behavior is not strongly health-oriented. The qualitative notes (outdoor pursuits, cycling, eating out) suggest some lifestyle interest in health, but not enough to override the quantitative evidence. The repeated rationale across runs consistently ties the attitudinal baseline (~38% agreement) to the evidence, and the distribution reflects moderate aspiration but not strong behavioral commitment. The evidence selection rationale is sound, and there is no indication of omitted or misapplied evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 26.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is best classified as a Health-Conscious Attitude (Category 6), which has a baseline of ~38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan and 4% vegetarian, with 76% eating meat and 18% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This indicates that while actual dietary behavior is not strongly health-oriented (low vegan/vegetarian rates), there may still be moderate aspirational agreement with healthy eating as an attitude. The qualitative notes (outdoor pursuits, cycling, eating out) suggest some lifestyle interest in health, but not overwhelmingly so. Therefore, the baseline is appropriate, and the evidence does not justify a higher agreement. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is best classified as a Health-Conscious Attitude (Category 6), which has a baseline of ~38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan and 4% vegetarian, with 76% eating meat and 18% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This indicates that while actual dietary change is rare, the question is about attitude, not behavior. The qualitative notes (outdoor pursuits, eating out, pets) suggest some lifestyle engagement but not a strong health focus. Therefore, the baseline is appropriate, and the evidence does not justify a higher agreement. The distribution reflects moderate aspiration toward healthy eating, but not strong behavioral follow-through. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is best classified as a Health-Conscious Attitude (Category 6), which has a baseline of ~38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan and 4% vegetarian, with 76% eating meat and 18% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while there is some openness to alternative diets, the vast majority are not strongly committed to restrictive healthy eating patterns. The qualitative notes (interest in eating out, outdoor pursuits) suggest some lifestyle alignment with health, but not a dominant health-obsessed culture. Therefore, the baseline is appropriate, with no strong evidence to increase or decrease agreement. The distribution reflects moderate aspiration toward healthy eating, but not strong behavioral commitment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is best classified as a Health-Conscious Attitude (Category 6), which has a baseline agreement of ~38%. The quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan and 4% vegetarian, with 76% eating meat and 18% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while there is some openness to alternative diets, the vast majority are not strongly committed to restrictive healthy eating patterns. The qualitative notes mention 'eating out' as a leisure activity, which may indicate a moderate interest in food but not necessarily a strong health focus. Therefore, the baseline is appropriate, and the evidence does not justify a higher agreement. The distribution reflects moderate agreement, with a significant neutral and disagreement segment, matching the attitudinal but not behavioral commitment to healthy eating in this segment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is best classified as a Health-Conscious Attitude (Category 6), which typically sees moderate agreement (~38%) due to its aspirational nature but lack of universal adoption. The quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan and 4% vegetarian, with 76% eating meat and 18% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, indicating that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary change is limited. This supports a moderate agreement level, not high. The qualitative notes (interest in eating out, outdoor pursuits) suggest some lifestyle orientation toward health, but not strongly enough to override the quantitative evidence. Therefore, the baseline for Health-Conscious Attitudes is used, with a slight downward adjustment due to the high prevalence of meat-eating and low prevalence of plant-based diets in this segment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently explains that the target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees high agreement due to social desirability and positive self-concept. The demographic profile (home-owning, above-average income families/couples) is appropriately used to justify a slight upward calibration from the category baseline. The quantitative evidence, while not directly about the target concept, is correctly interpreted as being about specific behaviors (which are usually lower than general attitudes about self-reliance). The qualitative notes are used to support the demographic adjustment. The repeated use of the category baseline, with minor adjustments, is methodologically sound in the absence of direct quantitative evidence. The confidence is high, but not maximal, due to the lack of direct evidence on the specific attitude. Overall, the justification is clear, balanced, and appropriately cautious.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 27.60%
  Slightly agree: 34.40%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.20%
  Strongly disagree: 7.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a statement about personal responsibility and competence, which tends to be socially desirable and widely endorsed, especially among home-owning, above-average income families (as described in the qualitative notes). Quantitative evidence is not directly about this concept, but related items (e.g., 'I only save for a specific purpose' at 28%, 'plans to use other investments for retirement' at 15%) suggest that while specific proactive behaviors are less common, the attitude of self-reliance is likely higher. Demographically, this segment is above average income, which slightly increases agreement (+3pp). No strong evidence to override the category baseline, so the estimate is close to the Self-Reliance Identity baseline: SA 28%, A 34%, N 18%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supportive demographics.
Run 2: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a statement about personal responsibility and competence, and is subject to social desirability bias. The segment is described as home-owning families/couples with above average incomes, which supports a slight upward calibration (+3pp for high income). Quantitative evidence is not directly on this concept, but related attitudes (e.g., 'I only save for a specific purpose' at 28%, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 34%) are lower, but these are effort-based or specific behaviors, not identity statements. The closest relevant evidence is the segment's above-average income and home ownership, which supports the baseline. Therefore, the estimate is slightly above the category baseline: SA 28%, A 34%, N 18%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supportive demographics, but not maximal due to lack of direct quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=27.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is an attitude about personal responsibility and competence, and is likely to be inflated by social desirability bias. The segment is described as home-owning families/couples with above average incomes, which supports a slight upward calibration (+3pp for high income). Quantitative evidence is not directly on this concept, but related attitudes (e.g., 'I only save for a specific purpose' at 28%, 'plans to use other investments for retirement' at 15%) are much lower, but these are about specific behaviors or plans, not general attitudes. The general attitude of self-reliance is almost always higher than actual saving/investing behaviors. Therefore, the baseline (SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%) is modestly increased for this affluent, home-owning segment. No strong evidence to override the category baseline, so the estimate remains close to the pattern for self-reliance identity statements.
Run 4: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is a positive self-concept/competence statement, and social desirability bias tends to inflate agreement. The segment is 'home owning families and couples with above average incomes,' which supports a slight upward calibration (+3pp) due to higher resources and likely greater confidence in self-reliance. Quantitative evidence is not directly on this concept, but related items ('I only save for a specific purpose' at 28%, 'plans to use other investments for retirement' at 15%) suggest that while specific savings behaviors are less common, the attitude of personal responsibility is likely higher than actual behavior. No evidence contradicts the baseline, so the estimate remains close to the category norm, with a slight upward adjustment for income. Distribution: SA 28%, A 34%, N 18%, D 12%, SD 8%.
Run 5: Strongly agree=27.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a statement about personal responsibility and competence, and such statements are generally viewed positively due to social desirability and aspirational self-concept. The segment is described as home-owning families/couples with above average incomes, which slightly increases agreement (+3pp for high income). Quantitative evidence is not directly about self-reliance for retirement, but related items show moderate agreement for effortful financial behaviors (e.g., switching utilities: 34%), and low agreement for using other investments for retirement (15%). However, these are about specific behaviors or alternative strategies, not the general principle of self-responsibility. Thus, the baseline for self-reliance identity (SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%) is used, with a slight upward calibration for higher income. Final estimate: SA 27%, A 36%, N 18%, D 12%, SD 7%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and segment profile.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category baseline, which is well-supported by both the attitudinal literature and the provided evidence. The quantitative data (high outgoings on utilities) is correctly interpreted as a potential motivator but not a decisive factor for overcoming effort aversion. The qualitative segment description (home-owning, above-average income) is appropriately used to justify a minor upward calibration, but not enough to override the category baseline. There is no evidence of unusually high proactivity or switching behavior in this segment, and the reasoning does not overstate the impact of the demographic calibration. The confidence is high due to the strong fit between the evidence and the estimate. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category, which typically sees low agreement (~30%) due to effort aversion, even when there is a potential cost saving. The segment is 'home owning families and couples with above average incomes,' which might slightly increase agreement due to higher financial literacy and more frequent engagement with utilities, but the baseline for effortful behaviors remains low. Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities, suggesting some incentive, but the direct behavior (switching) still requires time and hassle, so the attitudinal agreement remains modest. Demographic calibration for above average income could add +2pp, but not enough to shift the category baseline significantly. Thus, the estimate is close to the category baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') is best classified as an 'Effort-Required Behavior' (Category 7), since it involves a non-trivial action (switching suppliers) that requires time and administrative effort, even if it may save money. The baseline for this category is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement). 

Segment evidence shows this group (aspiring communities) are home-owning families/couples with above average incomes, but there is no direct evidence of unusually high switching or effort-prone behaviors. Quantitative evidence about sporting event attendance (0.20) and places of worship (0.09) suggests moderate to low engagement in extra activities, not a highly proactive segment. Outgoings are high, but this does not directly imply greater willingness to switch utilities (could even indicate inertia). 

Demographic calibration: Above average income could add +2pp to agreement, but the effort barrier dominates. No evidence to override the category baseline. 

Therefore, the baseline distribution for effort-required behaviors is used, with high confidence due to strong category fit and lack of evidence to shift the estimate.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' falls under the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category, which typically sees low agreement (~30%) due to time/effort aversion, even when there is a potential for cost savings. The provided segment describes 'home owning families and couples with above average incomes,' which could slightly increase agreement due to higher financial literacy and motivation to optimize expenses, but the baseline for effortful behaviors remains low. Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities, which may increase awareness of potential savings, but the actual behavior (switching) still requires effort. No direct evidence suggests this group is unusually proactive about switching. Therefore, the estimate is close to the category baseline, with a slight upward calibration for above-average income (+2pp), but not enough to shift it out of the low-agreement range. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting demographic context.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category, which typically sees low agreement (~30%) due to time/effort aversion, even if there is a potential cost saving. The segment is 'home owning families and couples with above average incomes,' which could slightly increase agreement due to higher financial literacy and incentive to optimize bills, but the baseline for effortful behaviors remains low. Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities, which may motivate some to consider switching, but the actual behavior is still limited by perceived hassle. No direct evidence suggests this group is unusually proactive about switching. Therefore, the estimate is close to the category baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the semantic category and supporting demographic context.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' falls into the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, while there may be a cost-saving incentive, the perceived hassle and time required to switch utilities is a significant barrier for most people. The quantitative evidence shows that this segment (Aspiring Communities) has above-average incomes and is composed of home-owning families and couples, which could slightly increase willingness to consider switching (due to higher stakes and financial literacy), but the baseline for effortful behaviors remains low. No direct evidence suggests unusually high switching activity or attitudes in this group. Therefore, the baseline distribution for effort-required behaviors is used, with a slight upward calibration for above-average income (+2pp to agreement), but not enough to shift the category. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the semantic pattern and supporting demographic context.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references both the quantitative toplines (showing moderate to low online purchase rates for everyday categories and moderate for higher-value items) and the qualitative note ('Internet usage: Moderate'), both of which support the conclusion that cash preference remains significant in this segment. The distribution closely follows the semantic category baseline, with minor adjustments reflecting the evidence. No major demographic or contextual factors are omitted, and the confidence in the evidence is appropriately high. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.40%

  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The statement 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the payment preference category, which typically sees moderate agreement (baseline: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13%). Quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcohol 20%, pet care 22%), moderate for appliances (51%), and higher for travel (59%), suggesting this segment is less digitally oriented than average. Qualitative note confirms 'moderate' internet usage, supporting a higher-than-average cash preference. Therefore, I slightly increase 'strongly agree' and 'slightly agree' above baseline. No strong demographic calibration is needed, as the evidence is segment-specific. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The statement 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the payment preference category, which typically sees moderate agreement (~37%) due to generational and demographic splits. Quantitative evidence shows that online purchasing rates are moderate to low for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 20%, pet care 22%), but higher for home appliances (51%) and holiday/travel (59%). This suggests that while online (non-cash) purchasing is growing, cash is still relevant for many in this segment, especially for lower-value or everyday purchases. The qualitative note of 'moderate' internet usage further supports that this group is not fully digital, so cash preference remains significant. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. The estimate closely follows the category baseline, with a slight nudge toward higher neutrality due to moderate digital adoption.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The statement 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the payment preference category, which has a baseline of ~37% agreement (SA+A). Quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 20%, pet care 22%), moderate for home appliances (51%), and higher for holidays/travel (59%). This suggests that this segment (Aspiring Communities) is less digitally oriented for routine purchases, supporting a moderate preference for cash. Qualitative evidence notes 'Internet usage: Moderate,' reinforcing that digital payment adoption is not universal. No strong demographic calibration is needed, as this is not an elderly or rural segment, but the moderate digital engagement supports the baseline. Distribution is centered with a slight lean toward agreement, reflecting both the baseline and the evidence. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' falls under the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~37% agreement (SA+A). The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 20%, pet care 22%), moderate for home appliances (51%), and higher for holiday/travel (59%). This suggests that this segment (Aspiring Communities) is less digitally oriented for routine purchases, supporting a moderate preference for cash. The qualitative note of 'Internet usage: Moderate' further supports that they are not heavy digital adopters, which aligns with a higher-than-average cash preference. No strong demographic calibration is needed, as this is not a high-age or rural segment, but the moderate digital engagement justifies using the category baseline without downward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of 37% agreement (13% strongly agree, 24% slightly agree). The quantitative evidence shows moderate online purchase rates for this segment (20% for alcohol, 22% for pet care, 51% for home appliances, 59% for travel), indicating that while online shopping is present, it is not dominant for everyday categories—suggesting a moderate to high cash preference remains. The qualitative note of 'Internet usage: Moderate' supports this, implying less digital payment reliance than highly online segments. No strong demographic calibration is needed, as the evidence aligns with the baseline. Confidence is high due to strong relevance of the evidence.
