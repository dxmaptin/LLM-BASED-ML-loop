### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.64
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale correctly identifies that the available quantitative data (country of birth, managing/arranging accounts by phone) are not directly relevant to the attitude concept being estimated. In the absence of direct or strong proxy evidence, the use of a conservative baseline template for attitude items is methodologically appropriate. The repeated application of this baseline across runs, with consistent rationale and moderate confidence due to lack of direct evidence, is sound. No revision is required unless new, directly relevant evidence becomes available.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative attitude baseline is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about agreement with the target concept, and the only quantitative data provided relates to behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging accounts by phone, country of birth), all with low prevalence (1-12%). These do not directly inform the attitude distribution, so the baseline is not adjusted. No qualitative evidence is present. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence and reliance on the baseline template.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the revised conservative attitude baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no strong quantitative evidence indicating higher or lower agreement for this segment, and the only quantitative toplines provided relate to behaviors (e.g., managing/arranging accounts by phone) with low prevalence (1-12%), which do not directly inform the attitude concept. No qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the baseline template is used without further adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative baseline template is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about the 'Concept' itself, and the retrieved quantitative data (e.g., 'manage current account by phone', 'country of birth') are not directly relevant to the attitude concept in question. No qualitative evidence is provided. Therefore, the baseline is applied with no further calibration. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative attitude baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about agreement with the 'Concept' statement, and the only retrieved quantitative data relates to unrelated behaviors (country of birth, managing/arranging accounts by phone), all with low prevalence (1-12%). No qualitative evidence is present. As per the evidence hierarchy, in the absence of direct or strong proxy data, the baseline template is used without further adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.60 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the conservative baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about the target concept, and the only quantitative data provided relates to country of birth and current account management by phone, which are not directly relevant to the attitude concept. No qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the baseline template for attitude is used without further adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the evidence hierarchy, giving dominant weight to the direct quantitative evidence (7% environmentalist identity, 26% negative view of energy companies), which is highly relevant and much lower than general population baselines. The predicted agreement (14% total) is well below the attitude template, reflecting the segment's low environmental concern. Disagreement is increased appropriately, and the rationale explains the adjustments clearly. There is no qualitative evidence to contradict the quantitative findings. The prediction avoids over-prediction and increases variance as instructed. Confidence is high due to the strong, direct quantitative evidence and consistent application of the system's guardrails.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 4.00%
  Slightly agree: 10.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 26.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=10.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=26.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events, for the 'family renters' segment. The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low: only 7% consider themselves environmentalists (file=ACORN_family_renters.csv, relevance=0.98), and only 26% think energy companies do not care about the environment (relevance=0.94). These are both much lower than general population averages for environmental concern. There is no direct evidence of positive attitudes toward sustainability in events, and the segment is likely to be price- and convenience-focused. According to the system's evidence hierarchy, direct quantitative data (7% environmentalist) dominates, so agreement must be very low. Using the attitude template as a base (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%), but correcting downward sharply for the direct evidence, I push agreement much lower and increase disagreement. This results in a highly skeptical profile: only 14% agree, 28% neutral, and 58% disagree. Confidence is high due to strong, direct quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=10.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=26.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events, for the 'family renters' segment. The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low: only 7% consider themselves environmentalists (file=ACORN_family_renters.csv, relevance=0.98), and only 26% think energy companies do not care about the environment (relevance=0.94). Both indicate low environmental concern in this segment. The baseline for attitude items is already conservative (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%), but the direct evidence (7% environmentalist) is much lower, so the prediction must be pushed even lower than the baseline, per the guardrails. I have weighted the direct quantitative evidence most heavily (80%), resulting in a very low agreement estimate (SA 4%, A 10%), with most respondents likely to disagree or be neutral. Variance is increased as instructed, and the prediction is well below the system's previous over-prediction bias. Confidence is high due to strong direct quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=10.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=26.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events. The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low agreement with environmentalist identity (7%) and low agreement that energy companies do not care about the environment (26%). There is no direct evidence of high environmental concern in this segment (family renters), and the closest proxy ("I consider myself an environmentalist") is only 7%. According to the evidence hierarchy, this direct quantitative data should dominate. The baseline for attitude items is already conservative (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%), but the direct evidence is much lower, so the prediction is pushed even lower, with only 14% total agreement and 58% disagreement. This matches the guidance to increase variance and avoid over-prediction. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=10.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=26.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', but direct quantitative evidence shows extremely low agreement with environmentalist identity (7%) and low agreement that energy companies don't care about the environment (26%) among family renters. The target item ('brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events') is closely related to environmentalist attitudes, so the direct evidence (7%) is highly relevant and must be weighted most heavily. The conservative baseline for attitude would be SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%, but the direct evidence is much lower, so the prediction is adjusted downward significantly. No qualitative evidence is available to counter this. The prediction is pushed to the low end of the scale, with only a small minority agreeing, and a majority disagreeing or neutral. Confidence is high due to the strong quantitative match.
Run 5: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=10.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=26.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events, for the 'family renters' segment. The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low: only 7% consider themselves environmentalists (file=ACORN_family_renters.csv, relevance=0.98), and only 26% think energy companies do not care about the environment (file=ACORN_family_renters.csv, relevance=0.94). These are both much lower than general population baselines for environmental concern. There is no evidence of strong pro-environmental attitudes in this segment. According to the evidence hierarchy, direct quantitative data (7% environmentalist) should dominate, so agreement must be predicted very low. The baseline for attitude items is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%, but this must be adjusted sharply downward due to the quantitative evidence. I have pushed both agreement categories down by more than half, and increased disagreement accordingly, to reflect the segment's low environmental concern. Variance is increased to avoid clustering around the mean. Confidence is high due to strong, direct quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run consistently references the concept-specific correction for this item, which is explicitly called out in the system prompt due to prior under-prediction. The quantitative evidence (very high outgoings on housing/utilities) is highly relevant and supports the prediction that cost-consciousness will drive higher agreement with the energy-saving behavior. The absence of direct quantitative evidence for the exact item is acknowledged, but the use of the system prompt's correction is methodologically sound. No further demographic or qualitative calibration is needed, as the correction already accounts for the segment's likely cost sensitivity. Confidence is high due to the strong alignment between the evidence and the prediction.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 8.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is an attitude item but with a strong behavioral/cost-conscious element. The V2 prompt specifies a concept-specific correction for this item: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8% (due to prior under-prediction and strong cost salience). Quantitative evidence shows this segment (family renters) spends heavily on housing/utilities (93.3%), which supports the idea that energy costs are salient. There is no direct quantitative evidence for this exact item, but the segment's high outgoings and likely budget sensitivity (as renters) support the higher agreement. No demographic calibration is needed beyond the concept-specific correction. Confidence is high due to the direct match to the concept-specific template and supporting context.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a high-friction behavior (requires ongoing effort and cost-consciousness). The V2 prompt specifies a concept-specific correction for this item: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%, due to prior under-prediction (-21pp). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows extremely high outgoings on housing and utilities (93.3%), which supports the idea that cost is salient and likely to drive energy-saving behaviors. There is no direct quantitative evidence for this exact behavior, but the segment's high utility spend and the concept-specific correction both support a higher-than-baseline prediction. No demographic calibration is needed, as the concept-specific correction already accounts for the segment's likely cost sensitivity. Confidence is high due to the strong concept-specific correction and supporting quantitative context.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-salience cost-consciousness attitude. The segment is 'ACORN family renters', who have very high outgoings on housing and utilities (93.3%), suggesting strong motivation to economize. There is no direct quantitative data for this exact item, but the concept-specific correction for this item is to INCREASE by 21pp due to prior under-prediction. The baseline for this item is: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. No demographic calibration is needed as the segment is not especially high or low income, and the qualitative evidence is neutral. The prediction is therefore anchored to the concept-specific template, with high confidence due to strong quantitative relevance of outgoings and the corrective adjustment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-friction behavior but, per V2 guidance, is a notable exception where under-prediction was observed (-21pp). The corrective template for this concept is: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Quantitative evidence for this segment shows extremely high outgoings on housing and utilities (93.3%), which supports the idea that cost-consciousness is likely to drive energy-saving behaviors. There is no direct quantitative evidence contradicting this, and qualitative evidence is not available. Demographic calibration is not applied further, as the concept-specific correction already accounts for the segment's likely cost sensitivity. Confidence is high due to the strong concept-specific correction and supporting quantitative context.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: 1. Concept type is 'attitude', but this specific item ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is called out in the system prompt as historically under-predicted, with a recommended correction: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. 2. Quantitative evidence: The segment spends heavily on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels (93.3% relevance), which suggests high salience of these costs and likely motivation to economize. 3. No direct quantitative data for this exact question, but the system prompt's correction is based on observed under-prediction for this item. 4. Qualitative evidence is not directly available, but the high outgoings on utilities supports the rationale for higher agreement. 5. Demographic calibration is not applied further, as the system prompt correction is already tailored for this concept. 6. Confidence is high due to the direct system prompt correction and supporting quantitative context.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.89
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative topline ('Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 34%) as a strong proxy for the concept in question. The application of the concept-specific correction (reducing by 30pp due to historic over-prediction) is appropriate and well-documented. There is no qualitative or demographic evidence suggesting the need for further adjustment. The repeated, consistent application of the evidence hierarchy and correction template across all runs demonstrates methodological rigor. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 5.00%
  Slightly agree: 15.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 30.00%
  Strongly disagree: 22.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude, but the evidence shows low agreement with environmental/fuel priorities in this segment. The most relevant quantitative topline is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low co2 emissions' at 34%, which is a close proxy but not an exact match. The V2 system prompt instructs to use the concept-specific correction for 'Fuel consumption important when buying car', which is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. This matches the evidence and corrects for the +30pp over-prediction bias seen previously. No qualitative evidence suggests higher agreement, and the segment (family renters) is not known for strong environmental/fuel priorities. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and a direct concept-specific correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', but the specific item ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is closely related to the provided quantitative topline: 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.34, relevance=0.98). This is a strong, direct proxy, as environmental concern and fuel consumption are highly correlated in car-buying context. The baseline for this concept (per system prompt) is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. This matches the concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car', which is reduced by 30pp from the original attitude baseline due to systematic over-prediction. The direct quantitative evidence (34% agreement) supports this lower estimate, and there is no evidence from qualitative notes to suggest a higher or lower value. Demographic calibration is not applied, as the evidence is strong and direct. Confidence is high due to the strong quantitative match.
Run 3: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', but the specific item ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is closely related to the provided quantitative topline: 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low co2 emissions' (value=0.34, relevance=0.98). This is a strong, direct quantitative anchor, and per the evidence hierarchy, it should dominate the estimate. The baseline for this concept (per system prompt) is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. This matches the concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car', which is to REDUCE by 30pp due to prior over-prediction. No qualitative evidence suggests a higher or lower value, and the demographic (family renters) does not warrant a significant upward or downward adjustment. The direct quantitative evidence (34% agreement) is slightly above the sum of SA+A (20%), but the system's correction is to predict lower than the topline due to historic over-prediction. Therefore, the template is applied as-is, with high confidence due to the strong quantitative match.
Run 4: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude, but the evidence shows low agreement with related environmental priorities in this segment (only 34% say environmentally friendly/low CO2 is important when buying a car, and just 26% think energy companies don't care about the environment). The segment also scores low on being well insured (12%), suggesting practical priorities may outweigh ideals. The V2 template for this concept (fuel consumption as most important) is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. This matches the evidence, which indicates that only a minority would prioritize fuel consumption above all else when buying a car. No demographic upweighting is justified for family renters. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude, but the evidence shows low agreement with environmental priorities in car buying among 'family renters' (quantitative: 34% rate environmental friendliness/low CO2 as important; only 12% say being well insured is important, and 26% are skeptical of energy companies' environmental care). The V2 system notes that 'fuel consumption important when buying car' was over-predicted by 30pp in V1, so the corrected template is SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. There is no evidence to suggest higher agreement for this segment, and the direct quantitative data (34%) supports a low agreement estimate. No demographic lift is warranted. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and a direct concept-specific correction.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the concept-specific correction template for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is warranted due to previously observed over-prediction. The available quantitative evidence for the ACORN family renters segment (low agreement with other attitudinal items, such as community engagement and risk aversion) supports the use of a conservative template and does not suggest a need for further adjustment. The absence of direct evidence on debt aversion is acknowledged, and the evidence hierarchy is respected. Confidence is high due to the use of a validated correction and consistent application of evidence-based reasoning. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. For this specific concept, the V2 prompt instructs to use a corrected template due to systematic over-prediction (+26pp bias previously). The baseline for this concept is: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. 

Quantitative evidence for this segment (ACORN family renters) shows low agreement with pro-social and risk-averse attitudes: only 7% help out in the community, 22% see climate change as a major threat, and 20% are comfortable with financial risk. These suggest a moderate but not overwhelming aversion to debt—likely lower than the general population, but the concept-specific correction already accounts for this. No direct quantitative evidence on debt aversion is present, so the concept-specific template is used without further downward adjustment. 

Confidence is high (0.82) because the concept-specific correction is based on observed over-prediction, and the available evidence does not contradict it.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The segment is 'ACORN family renters'. Direct quantitative evidence for debt aversion is not present, but related attitudes show low agreement rates: only 7% help out in the community, 22% see climate change as the biggest threat, 25% likely to move, and 20% are risk-tolerant with money. These low agreement rates suggest this segment is less likely to strongly agree with attitudinal statements than the general population. The concept-specific correction for 'don't like being in debt' is to use: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (already adjusted for +26pp over-prediction in v1). No evidence suggests this group is more debt-averse than average, so no demographic lift is applied. The prediction is anchored to the corrected template, with high confidence due to strong quantitative evidence of low agreement across attitudinal items.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The segment is 'ACORN family renters', for which we have several relevant quantitative toplines: low community engagement (7%), low climate threat concern (22%), moderate likelihood to move (25%), and low risk tolerance (20%). None of these suggest strong aversion to debt, and there is no direct evidence of high debt aversion in this group. The concept-specific correction for this item is to use a lower baseline (SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%), reflecting the +26pp over-prediction bias found in v1. No demographic calibration is warranted, as renters may be more familiar with debt but not necessarily more averse. The evidence hierarchy is respected: direct quantitative evidence is low for strong attitudes, so the conservative template is applied. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear concept-specific correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The segment is 'ACORN family renters', for which we have several relevant quantitative toplines: very low rates of community engagement (7%), low concern for climate change (22%), low likelihood to move (25%), and low risk appetite (20%). These all indicate a generally low level of strong attitudes or engagement, and suggest a more neutral or even indifferent stance on many issues. The concept-specific correction for 'don't like being in debt' is to use: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (down from the original over-predicted 68% agreement). There is no direct quantitative evidence for debt aversion in this segment, so the concept-specific correction is applied without further upward adjustment. No demographic calibration is warranted, as renters may be more familiar with debt but not necessarily more averse. The evidence is moderately strong due to the concept-specific correction and the segment's generally low engagement profile. Confidence is high due to the use of a validated correction template.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The segment (ACORN family renters) shows low agreement with other prudent/communal attitudes: only 7% help out in the community, 22% see climate change as a major threat, and 20% are comfortable taking financial risks. These low agreement rates suggest a lower-than-average aversion to debt, especially compared to national averages. The concept-specific correction for this item is to use: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. This is lower than the original attitude template, reflecting the +26pp over-prediction bias for this concept. No direct quantitative evidence on debt aversion is present, so the concept-specific correction is applied without further demographic lift. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and the use of a validated correction template.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.73
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I am very good at managing money' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently references the relevant quantitative proxies: low rates of online savings management (21%), high miscellaneous spending (38.8%), and low worry about car theft (5%), all of which plausibly indicate lower financial engagement or confidence among family renters. The demographic context (family renters) is appropriately considered, and the lack of direct attitudinal or qualitative evidence is acknowledged, leading to a conservative adjustment from the attitude baseline. The repeated runs show internal consistency and careful calibration. While direct self-assessment data would improve confidence, the use of strong proxies and demographic reasoning makes the estimate robust within the constraints of the evidence. No major revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 32.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.40%
  Strongly disagree: 15.40%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I am very good at managing money'), so the attitude baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows only 21% manage savings online (suggesting low financial engagement/confidence), and only 5% are very worried about car theft (suggesting low risk aversion or financial anxiety). There is no direct evidence of strong money management skills in this segment. The high spend on miscellaneous goods (38.8%) may indicate less disciplined budgeting. No qualitative evidence is available to counter this. Therefore, I slightly lower agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement compared to the baseline. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct attitudinal data but strong quantitative proxies.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.74 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I am very good at managing money'). The baseline for attitudes is: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows only 21% manage savings accounts online (suggesting low financial engagement/confidence), and only 5% are very worried about car theft (suggesting low risk aversion, possibly less financial vigilance). No direct evidence of high financial competence or confidence. No qualitative evidence provided. Demographic is 'family renters', who typically have tighter budgets and may feel less in control of finances, but the evidence does not support a higher agreement. Therefore, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. Confidence is moderate due to strong quantitative proxies but lack of direct attitudinal data.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I am very good at managing money'), so the attitude baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows only 21% manage savings online (suggesting low financial engagement/confidence), and only 5% are very worried about car theft (suggesting low risk aversion, possibly less financial vigilance). No direct evidence of high financial competence or confidence. The demographic (family renters) typically faces more financial pressure and instability, which often correlates with lower self-assessed financial management skills. Therefore, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement versus the baseline. No strong qualitative evidence is present, so the prediction is weighted toward the quantitative data and conservative demographic calibration. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct self-assessment data.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.74 / Rationale: 1. Concept type is 'attitude', so the conservative baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. 2. Quantitative evidence: Only 21% manage savings online (suggests low financial engagement/confidence), and only 5% are very worried about car theft (suggests low risk aversion, possibly less financial vigilance). 3. No direct quantitative evidence on self-assessed money management skill, but the low online savings management and the 'family renters' segment (typically younger, lower income, more financially stretched) suggest lower confidence. 4. Demographic calibration: No strong upward adjustment; if anything, slight downward nudge for renters. 5. Increased variance: Pushed 'neither' and 'slightly disagree' higher to reflect likely self-doubt and financial stress. 6. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong proxy evidence and clear demographic patterns.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.74 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an attitude item. For the ACORN family renters segment, direct quantitative evidence is limited, but we do have some relevant proxies: only 21% manage savings accounts online (suggesting low financial engagement/confidence), and only 5% are very worried about car theft (suggesting low financial anxiety, but not necessarily high financial competence). The high spend on miscellaneous goods/services (38.8%) may indicate less disciplined budgeting. The baseline for attitude items is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low online savings management and high miscellaneous spending, I reduce agreement by 4pp and increase neutrality/disagreement. No evidence suggests this group is especially confident with money. No strong demographic calibration applies. Confidence is moderate-high due to relevant proxies, but not direct measurement.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.90
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for agreement with 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is well justified. The rationale consistently applies a concept-specific correction based on prior over-prediction bias (+40pp), and the use of the HIGH FRICTION BEHAVIOR template is appropriate given the nature of the concept. The quantitative topline for a similar practical attitude ('fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is low (15%), supporting the inference that this segment deprioritizes precautionary or protective behaviors. There is no direct insurance data, but the indirect evidence is strong and no qualitative or demographic evidence contradicts the approach. The repeated, consistent application of the correction and the explicit rationale for not applying demographic calibration further strengthen the justification. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is a classic over-prediction risk, as shown in the V1 error analysis (+40pp bias). The V2 prompt instructs to use the HIGH FRICTION BEHAVIOR template and apply the concept-specific correction: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. Quantitative evidence from this segment (e.g., only 15% say fuel consumption is most important when buying a car) shows low prioritization of practical, protective, or cost-saving features, supporting a low agreement estimate. No direct insurance data is present, so the concept-specific correction dominates. Demographic calibration is not applied, as there is no evidence that 'family renters' are more insurance-focused. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with both the concept-specific correction and the segment's low-priority attitudes for similar practical features.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is subject to a specific correction due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp in prior rounds). The concept type is high friction behavior (insurance is costly, effortful, and not prioritized by this segment). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the low agreement (0.15) for 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'—another high friction, practical attitude—indicating this segment does not prioritize precautionary or cost-avoidance behaviors. No direct insurance data is present, so the concept-specific correction is applied: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. This matches the revised template for this item. Demographic calibration is not applied further, as the evidence is strong and the segment (family renters) is not known for high insurance uptake. Confidence is high due to the strong quantitative anchor and direct concept-specific correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is subject to a specific correction due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp in v1). The correct template is the HIGH FRICTION BEHAVIOR correction: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. Quantitative evidence for this segment (family renters) shows low prioritization of practical, cost-conscious features (e.g., only 15% say fuel consumption is most important when buying a car), suggesting low agreement with high-friction, comprehensive insurance. No direct evidence contradicts the template, and demographic calibration is not warranted (family renters are not high-income or elderly). No qualitative evidence is available to override the quantitative toplines. Confidence is high due to direct concept-specific correction and strong quantitative alignment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is subject to a specific corrective template due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp bias in v1). The correct template is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. Quantitative evidence for this segment (ACORN family renters) shows low agreement with other 'responsibility' or 'prudent' attitudes (e.g., only 15% say fuel consumption is most important when buying a car), supporting a low agreement prediction. No direct evidence suggests higher insurance prioritization. Demographic calibration is not applied, as renters/families are not especially likely to over-index on insurance. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and the use of a concept-specific correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is subject to a specific corrective template due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp bias in prior rounds). The most relevant quantitative evidence is for a similar attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), which is very low (15% agreement), indicating this segment (ACORN family renters) does not prioritize risk-averse or cost-protective attitudes. No direct evidence supports high agreement for insurance importance. Demographic calibration is not applied, as the evidence is strong and overrides it. The concept-specific correction for 'well insured for everything' is used: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. Confidence is high due to the direct, highly relevant quantitative evidence and the established correction template.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.86
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The topline attitude estimates for 'Healthy Eating' are consistently and transparently derived from the quantitative evidence: extremely low vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.2%) rates, a large majority eating meat (78%), and a moderate pescatarian/flexitarian/other group (16.5%). The rationale for lowering agreement from the attitude baseline is clearly explained and consistently applied across runs. The absence of strong qualitative evidence is correctly noted, and the confidence in the adjustment is appropriate given the strength and relevance of the quantitative data. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 32.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 16.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). Quantitative evidence shows extremely low vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.2%) rates, with a large majority (78%) eating meat and 16.5% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may value healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the data, agreement should be LOWERED: the low rates of vegan/vegetarianism indicate less strong commitment to healthy eating ideals, so both 'strongly agree' and 'slightly agree' are reduced, and 'neither' and 'disagree' are increased. No qualitative evidence is present to counter this. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). Direct quantitative evidence shows extremely low vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.2%) rates, with a large majority (78%) eating meat and 16.5% in pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. The attitude template baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the evidence, agreement should be adjusted downward: strong agreement is likely lower than baseline, as healthy eating is not a dominant behavioral pattern. Disagreement is slightly higher, reflecting the prevalence of meat-eating and low plant-based adoption. No strong qualitative evidence to override this. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative data.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: 1) Concept type: This is an attitude item (Healthy Eating), so the attitude baseline applies (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%). 2) Quantitative evidence: The segment is overwhelmingly meat-eating (78%), with very low vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) rates, and a moderate minority (17%) pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may express positive attitudes toward healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly health-oriented. 3) Calibration: Given the low prevalence of plant-based diets, agreement with 'Healthy Eating' as a value is likely lower than the baseline. I reduce both 'agree' categories by 5pp and increase 'disagree' and 'neither' accordingly. 4) No strong qualitative evidence is present. 5) Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). Direct quantitative evidence shows extremely low vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.2%) rates, with a high proportion eating meat (78%) and a moderate minority in pescatarian/flexitarian/other (16.5%). This suggests that while some may value healthy eating, actual dietary choices do not strongly reflect health-motivated restrictions. The attitude template baseline (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%) is adjusted downward due to the strong quantitative evidence of low adoption of health-associated diets. The 'neither' and 'disagree' categories are increased to reflect the segment's actual eating habits, and agreement is reduced. Confidence is high due to strong, direct quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude type). Direct quantitative evidence shows extremely low vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.2%) rates, with a high proportion eating meat (78.5%) and a moderate minority in pescatarian/flexitarian/other (16.6%). This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. The baseline attitude template (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%) is adjusted downward for agreement and upward for disagreement, reflecting the low prevalence of plant-based diets and the dominance of meat-eating. No strong qualitative evidence is present to counter the quantitative data. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.80
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run consistently references the most relevant quantitative proxies available (notably the low 13% planning for retirement and moderate agreement with related financial attitudes), and applies a conservative attitude baseline appropriately. The lack of direct evidence is acknowledged, and the absence of strong qualitative or demographic lifts is correctly noted. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the confidence level is appropriately moderate-high given the strength of the proxies. No major methodological gaps are present.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 11.20%
  Slightly agree: 26.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 29.20%
  Slightly disagree: 19.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.40%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about personal responsibility for retirement security. There is no direct quantitative evidence for this exact item, but the closest proxy ('Plans to use other investments for retirement', 13%) suggests low proactive planning for retirement among family renters. Other attitudes (e.g., 'I only save for a specific purpose', 34%) indicate a lack of broad, future-oriented saving behavior. The baseline for attitude items is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. No demographic lift is warranted, as this segment is not high-income or highly financially engaged. The evidence hierarchy prioritizes the low 13% planning figure, which supports a conservative (lower agreement) estimate. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong proxy quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=11.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=29.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude', so the conservative baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence for this exact statement, but related items (e.g., 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' at 13%) suggest low proactive engagement with retirement planning in this segment. Other attitudes (e.g., 'I only save for a specific purpose' at 34%) indicate a somewhat pragmatic but not highly proactive approach to financial planning. No qualitative evidence suggests higher agreement. Therefore, I stick close to the conservative attitude baseline, with a slight upward nudge for agreement due to the segment's moderate trust in financial tools (53% trust price comparison sites), but not enough to warrant a major lift. Confidence is moderate-high due to multiple relevant quantitative proxies.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about personal responsibility for retirement security. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (13%), which is low, suggesting weak proactive behavior in this segment. Other financial attitudes (e.g., 'I only save for a specific purpose' at 34%, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 32%) also indicate moderate to low financial engagement and initiative. The baseline for attitude items is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low evidence for proactive retirement planning, I slightly increase 'neither' and 'disagree' categories, and keep 'agree' categories close to baseline. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative proxies.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The item is an attitude statement. There is no direct quantitative evidence for this exact concept, but related items show relatively low agreement on proactive financial behaviors among family renters (e.g., only 13% plan to use other investments for retirement, 34% only save for a specific purpose, 32% think switching utilities is worth the effort). This suggests a moderate-to-low sense of personal financial agency and responsibility. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low agreement on related items, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No strong demographic lift is warranted. Confidence is moderate-high due to multiple relevant quantitative proxies.
Run 5: Strongly agree=11.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=29.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement, so the Attitude baseline template applies: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows only 13% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting low proactive retirement planning), and only moderate agreement with related financial attitudes (e.g., 32% agree switching utilities is worth the effort, 34% only save for a specific purpose). This supports a slightly lower-than-baseline agreement, but not dramatically so, as the statement is about responsibility (not action). No strong evidence for high agreement, so I avoid over-prediction. Demographic is 'family renters', who are less likely to feel secure or empowered about retirement, so no upward calibration. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.80
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the concept-specific correction for high friction behaviors, referencing both the baseline and the required -15pp adjustment due to prior over-prediction. The quantitative evidence (moderate outgoings, no sign of high price sensitivity or switching) and qualitative context (neutral, no evidence of higher/lower motivation) are appropriately considered. No demographic lift is applied, which is justified by the lack of strong evidence for above-average switching motivation among family renters. The confidence is moderate-high to high, and the evidence selection is balanced and appropriate. No further revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort', which is classified as a high friction behavior. The baseline for high friction behavior is: SA 5%, A 18%, N 27%, D 28%, SD 22%. The segment is 'family renters', who have moderate outgoings on utilities (quantitative: £3169/year on council tax, utilities, etc.), but there is no evidence of unusually high price sensitivity or proactive switching. The sporting event and place of worship visitation rates are low and not directly relevant. No qualitative evidence suggests higher or lower switching motivation. Therefore, I use the concept-specific correction for this item (which is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%), as per the prompt, since this item had a +15pp over-prediction bias in v1. No further demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment with the concept-specific template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as a high friction behavior, as it requires effort and is often subject to inertia. The quantitative evidence for this segment (ACORN family renters) does not indicate unusually high engagement with financial optimization behaviors or strong cost-saving attitudes—outgoings on utilities are typical, and there is no evidence of high rates of switching or strong cost sensitivity. The baseline for high friction behavior is SA 5%, A 18%, N 27%, D 28%, SD 22%. However, the concept-specific correction for this item is to REDUCE by 15pp due to systematic over-prediction, resulting in: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. No demographic lift is warranted, as renters may be slightly more likely to consider switching but also face barriers (e.g., tenancy restrictions). No direct quantitative evidence overrides this, so the corrected template is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment with both the evidence hierarchy and the concept-specific correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort', which is classified as a high friction behavior (requires effort, inertia is strong). The segment is 'family renters', who have moderate outgoings on utilities (quantitative: £3169/year on council tax, utilities, etc.), but there is no direct evidence of high switching activity or strong motivation to switch. The concept-specific correction for this item (per system prompt) is to use: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. No quantitative evidence suggests higher or lower agreement, and qualitative context is neutral. Demographic calibration is not applied as there is no strong evidence of above-average cost sensitivity or switching behavior. Confidence is moderately high due to direct concept-specific correction and lack of conflicting evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as a high friction behavior. The V2 template for this is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about switching utilities, but the segment (family renters) shows moderate outgoings on utilities and housing, which may indicate some cost sensitivity but not necessarily high motivation to switch. Sporting event and place of worship attendance are low, suggesting moderate to low engagement in community or extra effort activities. No qualitative evidence suggests unusually high or low switching motivation. Therefore, the concept-specific correction for this item is applied directly, with no further demographic lift or reduction. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as a high friction behavior, as it requires effort and is often subject to inertia. The segment (family renters) shows moderate outgoings on utilities, but there is no direct evidence of high switching activity or strong motivation to switch. Quantitative evidence from similar concepts and previous over-prediction bias (+15pp) suggests agreement is lower than intuition might suggest. The baseline for high friction behavior is SA 5%, A 18%, N 27%, D 28%, SD 22%. The concept-specific correction for this item is to REDUCE by 15pp, resulting in SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. No demographic calibration is warranted, as renters may be slightly more motivated to switch, but not enough to override the conservative correction. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with both the evidence hierarchy and the concept-specific correction.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies a concept-specific correction to the attitude baseline, which is appropriate given the history of over-prediction for this item. The quantitative toplines for online purchase rates are used as reasonable proxies for digital adoption and, by extension, cash preference. The evidence is interpreted correctly: lower online rates for everyday items suggest a moderate (but not high) cash preference, while higher rates for appliances and travel indicate some digital engagement. The absence of strong qualitative evidence is acknowledged, and the prediction does not overstate certainty. The repeated application of the correction template is methodologically sound given the available evidence. No further revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 23.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases' for the ACORN Family Renters segment. This is an attitude item, so the baseline template would be: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, the concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to REDUCE by 12pp due to over-prediction in previous rounds, so the template is: SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 19%, pet care 24%), but higher for home appliances (52%) and travel (54%). This suggests moderate digital adoption, but not as high as the UK average. There is no direct quantitative evidence for cash preference, but the moderate online rates suggest a moderate-to-low preference for cash. No qualitative evidence is available. Therefore, I use the concept-specific correction template without further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases' for the ACORN family renters segment. This is an attitude item, so the baseline would be: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, the concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to reduce by 12pp due to over-prediction in previous rounds, resulting in: SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for alcohol (19%) and pet care (24%), but higher for home appliances (52%) and holidays (54%). This suggests a mixed digital adoption profile, but not a strong cash preference overall. No direct quantitative evidence on cash use, so the concept-specific correction is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is moderately high due to strong quantitative proxies and a clear correction template.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.84 / Rationale: The concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases' for the ACORN family renters segment. This is an attitude item, so the attitude baseline is: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, the concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to reduce by 12pp due to over-prediction in v1, so the template is: SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 19%, pet care 24%), but higher for appliances and travel (52%, 54%). This suggests moderate digital adoption, but not as high as the UK average. Therefore, cash preference is likely slightly above national average, but not dominant. No strong qualitative evidence is available. The prediction closely follows the corrected template, with moderate agreement and a substantial neutral/disagree group. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the low online purchase rates for everyday categories among ACORN family renters: Alcoholic drinks (19%), Pet care (24%), Home appliances (52%), Holiday/travel (54%). The low online rates for everyday items (alcohol, pet care) suggest a moderate-to-high preference for in-person or traditional payment methods, but not an overwhelming one. The concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to reduce agreement by 12pp from the attitude baseline, due to higher digital adoption than attitudes suggest. Applying this correction to the attitude template (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%) yields: SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. No strong qualitative evidence is present, so the prediction is weighted 80% on the quantitative toplines, which support a moderate but not high cash preference. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases' for the ACORN family renters segment. This is an attitude item, so the attitude baseline applies. However, the concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' (reduce by 12pp from v1) is required due to systematic over-prediction. Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 19%, pet care 24%), but higher for home appliances (52%) and holidays (54%). This suggests moderate digital adoption, but not as high as the general population. Therefore, cash preference is likely somewhat above average, but not dominant. The corrected template (SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%) is applied without further demographic lift, as family renters are not strongly skewed toward cash or digital. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies for digital behavior.
