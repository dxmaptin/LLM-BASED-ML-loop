### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.72
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale correctly identifies that the available quantitative evidence (country of birth, banking behaviors) is not directly relevant to the unspecified 'attitude' concept, and the qualitative notes only provide general demographic context. The use of the V4 baseline for attitudes is appropriate in the absence of concept-specific anchors or directly relevant quantitative data. The repeated rationale across runs demonstrates consistency and adherence to the evidence hierarchy. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The segment ('Flourishing Capital') is affluent, young, and urban, but there is no concept-specific anchor or evidence to justify deviation from the baseline. Quantitative evidence provided relates to banking behaviors and country of birth, but none are directly relevant to the attitude concept in question. Qualitative notes confirm the demographic is successful, younger, and urban, but without a concept-specific anchor, the general attitude baseline is most appropriate. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction required, as the prompt does not specify a particular attitude (such as 'healthy eating' or 'environmental sustainability') that would trigger a major adjustment. The demographic context (Flourishing Capital: successful younger singles/couples in expensive London flats) would normally warrant a slight upward calibration for 'young' and 'affluent', but V4 reduces demographic adjustments by 50%, and the evidence provided is not directly related to the attitude concept. Quantitative evidence is not directly relevant to the attitude item, so the general baseline is most appropriate. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment with the V4 template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude,' so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction or anchor distribution provided. The demographic context (Flourishing Capital: successful younger singles/couples in expensive London flats) could suggest slightly higher agreement for some progressive or financial attitudes, but the evidence provided is not directly related to the concept, and the quantitative values are low and not concept-specific. Therefore, the general V4 attitude baseline is most appropriate. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct concept evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated for a generic 'Concept' item, and no strong demographic calibration is warranted. The segment is 'Flourishing Capital' (successful younger singles/couples in expensive London flats), which might slightly increase agreement for some progressive or aspirational attitudes, but the evidence provided is not specific enough to justify deviation from the V4 attitude baseline. Quantitative evidence is not directly relevant to the concept, so the baseline is maintained. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment with the V4 template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided is not directly related to the target concept (general attitudes), but does indicate a cosmopolitan, younger, successful demographic (from qualitative notes), which might slightly increase agreement for some progressive attitudes. However, V4 demographic calibrations are now reduced by 50%, and the evidence hierarchy prioritizes direct quantitative data (which is not present for this concept). Therefore, the general attitude baseline is used without further adjustment. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment with the V4 template and lack of conflicting evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 corrected baseline for this attitude concept, which is appropriate given the evidence of systematic over-prediction in previous versions. Quantitative evidence from the segment (16% self-identifying as environmentalist, 27% skeptical of energy companies' environmental care) supports the use of a low agreement baseline. The qualitative note indicates some attitudinal support but not enough to override the quantitative data. The decision not to apply upward demographic calibration is well-supported, as the affluent segment does not show strong environmental engagement in the quant data. The evidence selection is balanced and contextually appropriate. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 23.00%
  Strongly disagree: 17.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude'. V4 baseline for 'environmental sustainability when putting on events' is 8/22/30/23/17 (30% agreement), reflecting a -15pp correction for systematic over-prediction. Quantitative evidence from this affluent segment shows only 16% self-identifying as environmentalist and 27% agreeing energy companies don't care about the environment, both below national averages and indicating moderate environmental concern. The qualitative note ('try to buy only from companies who are socially and environmentally responsible') suggests some attitudinal support, but not enough to override the low quant scores. No evidence justifies raising above the V4 baseline. Therefore, use the corrected V4 template for this concept and segment. Confidence is high due to strong quant alignment and cross-class consistency.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% SA, 22% A, 30% N, 23% D, 17% SD (30% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3. Quantitative evidence shows only 16% consider themselves environmentalists and 27% think energy companies don't care about the environment, both indicating low direct environmental engagement in this affluent segment. The qualitative note ('try to buy only from companies who are socially and environmentally responsible') suggests some attitudinal support, but not enough to override the low quantitative scores. No strong demographic calibration is warranted for this affluent segment. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, with no upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between the V4 correction and the segment's actual environmental attitudes.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4's cross-class analysis shows systematic over-prediction for this concept, so the corrected baseline is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this affluent segment shows only 16% consider themselves environmentalists and 27% think energy companies don't care about the environment, both indicating relatively low environmental engagement. The qualitative note ('try to buy only from companies who are socially and environmentally responsible') suggests some attitudinal support, but this is not strongly reflected in the quantitative data. No evidence justifies raising the baseline. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied without upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class consistency and supporting quant evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events. V4 cross-class analysis shows systematic over-prediction for this concept, so the baseline is set at 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). Quantitative evidence from this affluent segment (Flourishing Capital) shows only 16% consider themselves environmentalists and 27% are skeptical of energy companies' environmental care—both low. The qualitative note ('try to buy only from companies who are socially and environmentally responsible') suggests a minority with strong views, but not a majority. No evidence supports raising the baseline. Therefore, the general V4 correction for this concept is applied without upward demographic calibration. The result is a low agreement rate, matching both the segment's data and the cross-class correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 cross-class analysis shows this item is systematically over-predicted, so the corrected baseline is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this affluent segment (Flourishing Capital) shows only 16% consider themselves environmentalists and 27% are skeptical of energy companies' environmental care—both low. The qualitative note ('try to buy only from companies who are socially and environmentally responsible') suggests some attitudinal support, but not enough to override the low quant scores. No strong demographic uplift is warranted (affluent class, but V4 reduces demographic calibration by 50%). Therefore, the general V4 correction for this concept is applied without upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quant alignment and cross-class consistency.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the V4 guidance that this attitude item ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home') is well-calibrated, with no systematic over- or under-prediction in prior rounds, so the baseline template is appropriate. The qualitative evidence ('make an effort to recycle but cost is a more important factor') is correctly interpreted as indicating pro-environmental attitudes moderated by cost, which aligns with the high baseline agreement. The quantitative evidence, while not directly related to energy-saving attitudes, does not contradict the estimate. The segment's affluence is noted, but no demographic calibration is needed as the baseline already fits affluent classes well. The confidence is appropriately high due to strong alignment with both the evidence and the V4 template. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.00%
  Slightly agree: 40.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 15.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ("make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home"), and V4 guidance indicates this is a well-calibrated concept—no systematic over- or under-prediction in prior rounds, so the baseline template is retained (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%). The qualitative note ('make an effort to recycle but cost is a more important factor') suggests pro-environmental attitudes are present but moderated by cost, which aligns with the baseline. No quantitative evidence directly contradicts this. The segment (Flourishing Capital) is affluent, but demographic calibration is not needed as the baseline already fits affluent classes well. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with both the evidence and the V4 template.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an 'attitude' concept, but for 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home', V4 identifies this as a well-calibrated item (no systematic over/under-prediction in V3), so the baseline is SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. The qualitative note ('make an effort to recycle but cost is a more important factor') suggests some pro-environmental attitudes, but with cost as a stronger motivator. However, in affluent segments like Flourishing Capital, both environmental and cost-saving motives can drive energy-saving behaviors. No quantitative evidence directly contradicts this. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, with no demographic calibration needed. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and supporting qualitative context.
Run 3: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but specifically about energy-saving at home, which V4 classifies as well-calibrated (no systematic error, so keep V3 values). The segment (Flourishing Capital) is affluent and likely to have higher agreement with pro-environmental attitudes, but the qualitative note ('cost is a more important factor') suggests that while recycling is valued, cost-saving may be a stronger motivator than sustainability per se. However, the baseline for this item is already high (70% agreement), and there is no strong evidence to adjust up or down. Quantitative evidence is not directly related to energy-saving attitudes, so the default template is most appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but with a strong behavioral component and is well-calibrated in V3/V4 (error <3pp), so the baseline for 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home' is SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The qualitative note ('Make an effort to recycle but cost is a more important factor') suggests pro-environmental attitudes are present but moderated by cost, which aligns with the high agreement baseline. No quantitative evidence directly contradicts this, and the segment (Flourishing Capital) is affluent, but demographic calibration is not needed as the baseline is already high and well-calibrated. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and supporting qualitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but specifically one that is well-calibrated in V4 (see prompt: 'Cut down gas/electricity at home' is to be kept at V3 values, as error was only -2.6pp). The segment (Flourishing Capital) is affluent, but the qualitative note ('make an effort to recycle but cost is a more important factor') suggests some pro-environmental attitudes, though cost sensitivity may temper action. However, the V4 template for this concept is already high (70% agreement), and the evidence does not suggest a need to adjust up or down. Quantitative evidence is not directly related to energy-saving attitudes, so the baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct match with a well-calibrated template and no strong contradictory evidence.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently recognizes the distinction between 'important' (as in the 0.56 quantitative value for environmentally friendly/low CO2) and 'most important' (the target concept), correctly noting that the former is broader and more inclusive. The qualitative evidence ('cost is a more important factor') is appropriately weighted, supporting the decision not to upweight agreement despite the segment's affluence. The repeated application of the V4 baseline is justified by both the evidence hierarchy and the systematic over-prediction observed in V3. The evidence selection is balanced, and the rationale is methodologically sound, with high confidence in the estimate.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 25.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action metric: 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.56). However, this is a broader and more positive framing than the target concept, which is more restrictive ('most important feature'). V4 guidance for this concept is to REDUCE by -5pp from V3 due to systematic over-prediction. The baseline for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The qualitative note ('cost is a more important factor') supports the idea that, even in affluent segments, fuel consumption is not the top priority. The quantitative evidence (0.56) is higher than the baseline, but since it refers to 'important' (not 'most important'), and the qualitative evidence suggests cost trumps eco/fuel concerns, the V4 baseline is appropriate. No demographic upweighting is needed (affluent segment, but V4 calibrations are now minimal). Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied directly.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude' but with a high-friction behavioral implication (prioritizing fuel consumption above all else when buying a car). V4 baseline for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), based on systematic over-prediction in V3. The strongest quantitative evidence is the action: 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.56), which is higher than the V4 baseline, but this is a broader environmental concern, not specifically fuel consumption as the single most important feature. Qualitative evidence ('cost is a more important factor') suggests that while environmental/fuel factors are considered, cost often takes precedence, supporting a lower agreement. The attitude about energy companies (0.27) and insurance (0.16) are less relevant but reinforce a moderate-to-low agreement tendency. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate for this segment, with no upward demographic calibration (affluent segment, but context shows cost is still key). Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchor and cross-class correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about fuel consumption being the most important feature when buying a new car. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action metric: 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 56%. However, this is a broader and more positive framing than the much narrower and more exclusive 'fuel consumption is the most important feature.' The qualitative note indicates that while this segment makes an effort to recycle, cost is a more important factor, suggesting that environmental/fuel concerns are not the top priority. The V4 baseline for this concept (fuel consumption) is 15% agreement (3% SA, 12% A), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3. The segment is affluent (Flourishing Capital), so a +2pp demographic calibration could be considered, but the qualitative evidence suggests not to overstate agreement. The evidence hierarchy puts the 56% action metric as related but not directly equivalent, so the V4 baseline is most appropriate. Therefore, the final estimate is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and supporting qualitative context.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about fuel consumption being the most important feature when buying a new car. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action metric: 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.56), which is notably higher than the V4 baseline for this concept (15% agreement). However, the qualitative note ('cost is a more important factor') and the lack of direct evidence for fuel consumption as the single most important feature suggest that while environmental/fuel factors are considered, they are not dominant. The V4 template for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%. Given the higher-than-baseline quantitative value, but also the qualitative evidence that cost trumps environmental/fuel concerns, I maintain the V4 baseline without upward adjustment. This is because the 0.56 value likely reflects broad consideration, not primacy, and the question here is about 'most important.' Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchoring and clear qualitative context.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action: 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.56), which is higher than the V4 baseline for this concept (agreement 15%). However, the qualitative note ('cost is a more important factor') suggests that while environmental/fuel concerns are present, cost dominates decision-making. The V4 template for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), based on systematic over-prediction in V3. The segment (Flourishing Capital) is affluent, but the demographic calibration is now only +2pp, which is not enough to override the strong qualitative evidence that cost is prioritized over fuel consumption. The 0.56 value for environmental friendliness is not directly about fuel consumption as the most important feature, so the V4 correction remains appropriate. Therefore, I use the V4 corrected baseline for this concept, with high confidence due to strong cross-class evidence and supporting qualitative context.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified. The rationale correctly identifies that the concept is a well-calibrated attitude item with a strong template fit (V4 guidance, low V3 error). The provided quantitative evidence (risk-taking with money, community involvement, climate concern) does not directly address debt aversion, and the qualitative profile (affluent, educated, family-oriented) does not strongly suggest deviation from the general population baseline. The repeated application of the baseline template is appropriate given the lack of contradictory or directly relevant evidence. Confidence is high due to the strong evidence base for the template and the absence of segment-specific data that would warrant adjustment. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'). V4 guidance says this item is well-calibrated (V3 error: -0.2pp), so the baseline template is used: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence from this segment (Flourishing Capital) does not directly address debt aversion, but related attitudes (risk-taking with money at 44%, climate concern at 28%) suggest a moderate to cautious financial profile, which aligns with the general population baseline. Demographic hints (family with children, degree) do not warrant a deviation from the baseline. No strong evidence to adjust up or down. Confidence is high due to direct match with well-calibrated template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' type, so the V4 baseline is SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. This matches the well-calibrated template for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which V3 and V4 found to be nearly perfectly predicted (error <1pp). No direct quantitative evidence on debt aversion is provided, but the segment's moderate risk tolerance (44% agree to risk-taking with money) and relatively low community engagement (14%) suggest a typical, not extreme, profile. The segment is affluent and educated, but these factors do not strongly shift debt aversion in UK datasets. Therefore, the general population baseline is appropriate, with no demographic calibration needed. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude statement. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the standard template: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The provided segment (Flourishing Capital) is affluent, educated, and family-oriented, but there is no direct evidence suggesting a significant deviation from the general population on debt aversion. The quantitative evidence provided (risk tolerance, community involvement, climate concern) does not directly relate to debt attitudes. Therefore, the general V4 template is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to the strong evidence base for this template and lack of contradictory segment-specific data.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' type, and for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', V4 guidance says this item is well-calibrated and should use the standard template: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The segment (Flourishing Capital) is affluent, family-oriented, and degree-educated, but there is no direct evidence that this group is more or less debt-averse than the general population. The closest quantitative evidence relates to risk-taking with money (44% agree), which is higher than average, but this does not directly translate to liking debt. The qualitative profile does not suggest a strong deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the general V4 template for this concept is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong template calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude item. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the standard attitude template: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The provided quantitative evidence (e.g., risk-taking with money at 44%) suggests a moderate openness to financial risk, but this does not directly contradict a dislike of debt, as risk-taking can coexist with debt aversion. The segment is affluent (Flourishing Capital), with families and higher education, which may slightly increase financial literacy but does not strongly shift debt aversion. No evidence suggests a need for demographic calibration. Therefore, the baseline V4 attitude distribution is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and well-calibrated baseline.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.81
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I am very good at managing money' is sufficiently justified given the evidence and the methodological approach described. The rationale consistently applies the V4 baseline for identity concepts, incorporates the concept-specific correction for over-prediction, and appropriately considers the demographic calibration for affluent segments. The quantitative evidence (high miscellaneous spending, high private car ownership, moderate online savings management) supports the segment's affluence and financial confidence but does not provide direct attitudinal data, which is acknowledged in the rationale. The qualitative note about London location is correctly treated as non-material to the estimate. The repeated application of the V4 corrected baseline, with no further upward or downward adjustment, is methodologically sound given the lack of contradictory evidence. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and error correction. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 34.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%

  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'identity' (self-assessment of money management skill). V4 baseline for 'good at managing money' is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), after correcting V3's +6pp over-prediction. Quantitative evidence is limited but does not contradict this: 35% manage savings online (suggests moderate digital engagement), high private car ownership (69%) and high miscellaneous spending (80.65) indicate affluence but not necessarily above-average self-perceived money management. No evidence for further upward or downward demographic calibration (Flourishing Capital is affluent, but V4 reduces demographic boosts by 50%, so no adjustment). Therefore, use the V4 corrected identity baseline. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for this concept is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3 due to a consistent over-prediction bias. The segment 'Flourishing Capital' is affluent and urban (predominantly London), but the demographic calibration for high income is now only +2pp and is already incorporated in the V4 baseline for this concept. No direct quantitative evidence on self-perceived money management is present, but the segment's high spending on miscellaneous goods and high rate of private car ownership suggest financial confidence, supporting the use of the V4 baseline without further upward adjustment. The qualitative note about London location does not alter the baseline. Therefore, the V4 corrected identity template is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and segment fit.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is classified as an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity concepts is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, for this specific concept, V4 applies a moderate correction (-6pp) due to systematic over-prediction in V3, resulting in SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). The provided quantitative evidence (e.g., 35% manage savings online, high miscellaneous spending, low car theft worry) does not strongly contradict or support a higher or lower self-assessment of money management. The segment (Flourishing Capital) is affluent and urban, but V4 demographic calibrations are now minimal (+2pp for high income), and the correction for this concept is already built in. Therefore, the V4 corrected template is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong cross-class evidence and well-calibrated error correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Concept type is IDENTITY ('I am very good at managing money'). V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10% (57% agreement), but for 'good at managing money' a moderate correction is required (-6pp from V3), so V4 uses SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). 

Segment is 'Flourishing Capital' (affluent, London-based, high spend on miscellaneous goods/services, high private car ownership, moderate online savings management). No direct quantitative evidence on self-perceived money management, but affluence and financial sophistication suggest slightly above-average confidence in money management. However, V4 mandates only moderate demographic calibration (+2pp for affluent classes, reduced from V3). This is already reflected in the concept-specific correction, so no further adjustment is needed.

No evidence suggests unusually high or low self-perceived money management. Therefore, use the V4 corrected identity baseline for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment profile and concept type, but not maximal due to lack of direct attitudinal data.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is classified as an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity concepts is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, the concept-specific correction for 'good at managing money' is to reduce agreement by 6pp from V3, resulting in SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9%. Quantitative evidence from this affluent segment (Flourishing Capital) does not indicate financial distress or low capability (e.g., high spending on miscellaneous goods/services, high car ownership, moderate online savings management), so no further downward adjustment is warranted. Demographic calibration for affluent classes is minimal (+2pp), but V4 reduces this by 50%, so the baseline is appropriate. No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the corrected template. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment profile and the identity template.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 guidance for a well-calibrated attitude concept, using the V3 baseline as instructed. The quantitative evidence (low agreement with 'fuel consumption is the most important feature') and qualitative evidence (cost is a more important factor) both support the conclusion that this segment is pragmatic and cost-conscious, with no indication of unusually high prioritization of insurance. There is no evidence suggesting the need for demographic calibration or deviation from the baseline. The evidence selection is balanced and contextually appropriate. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence for this segment (Flourishing Capital) shows only 14% agree that 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', indicating a relatively low prioritization of practical/precautionary features. The qualitative note ('cost is a more important factor') further suggests that comprehensive insurance is unlikely to be a high priority, as cost-consciousness may override a desire for full coverage. There is no evidence to suggest a higher agreement than the general baseline, so the V4 template is applied without upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between the evidence and the baseline template.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this is a well-calibrated concept, so the baseline template is retained: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. Quantitative evidence from the segment ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' at 14%) suggests practical, cost-focused priorities, and the qualitative note ('Make an effort to recycle but cost is a more important factor') reinforces a pragmatic, cost-sensitive mindset. There is no evidence of unusually high insurance prioritization in this affluent segment, so no demographic calibration is applied. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative and qualitative alignment with the baseline.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is an attitude item. According to the V4 prompt, this specific concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence from the segment ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' at 14%) suggests that practical, cost-related considerations outweigh idealistic attitudes in this affluent segment. The qualitative note ('Make an effort to recycle but cost is a more important factor') reinforces that cost-consciousness is a priority, likely reducing the proportion who strongly agree with being 'well insured for everything.' No evidence suggests a need to adjust the well-calibrated baseline. Therefore, the V3/V4 template is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong alignment between evidence and the template.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude' (not identity or high-friction behavior). For 'It is important to be well insured for everything', V4 guidance is to KEEP V3 values, as this concept is well-calibrated (V3 error +2.9pp). The baseline for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment (Flourishing Capital) shows only 14% agree that 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', suggesting a pragmatic, cost-driven approach rather than strong idealism. Qualitative note ('cost is a more important factor') further supports a practical, not risk-averse, mindset. No evidence suggests higher agreement with insurance importance than the general baseline. Therefore, use the V4 baseline for this concept. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative calibration and lack of evidence for deviation.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.80 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is an attitude item. According to the V4 prompt, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence for this segment (Flourishing Capital) shows low agreement with similar 'responsibility/cost' attitudes (e.g., only 14% agree that fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car), and the qualitative note emphasizes cost-consciousness over idealistic behaviors. There is no evidence of unusually high insurance prioritization in this segment. Therefore, the general population baseline is appropriate, with no upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative and qualitative alignment.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes in the Flourishing Capital segment is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 correction for systematic over-prediction, which is well-documented in the run-level detail. The quantitative evidence (very low vegan/vegetarian rates, majority meat-eaters) robustly supports the conclusion that healthy eating is not a dominant behavioral norm in this segment. The qualitative notes (eating out, gardening, cycling) are appropriately interpreted as not indicating a strong health focus. No demographic upweighting is warranted, given the affluent but not health-obsessed profile. The confidence is high due to the strong alignment between the evidence and the estimate, and the repeated, consistent application of the correction across runs. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 26.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a -22pp correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction in all classes. Quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 5% vegetarian, 33% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, and 59% meat-eaters in this affluent segment. This suggests a moderate but not high prevalence of healthy eating attitudes, as most are not strictly plant-based. Qualitative notes (eating out, gardening) do not strongly indicate a health focus. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline (12% strongly agree, 26% slightly agree, 26% neither, 22% slightly disagree, 14% strongly disagree) is appropriate. No demographic upweighting is applied, as the affluent segment does not show exceptional health orientation in the data. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear V4 correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude type), and V4 mandates a major correction (-22pp) due to systematic over-prediction in all classes. The quantitative evidence shows this affluent segment (Flourishing Capital) is overwhelmingly omnivorous (59% eats meat, only 1% vegan, 5% vegetarian, 33% pescatarian/flexitarian/other). This suggests that while there may be some awareness or positive attitude toward healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. Qualitative notes (eating out, gardening) do not indicate a strong health focus. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' (SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%) is appropriate and supported by the evidence. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and the cross-class correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is set at 38% agreement (SA+A). Quantitative evidence shows this affluent segment is overwhelmingly omnivorous (59% eat meat, only 1% vegan, 5% vegetarian, 33% pescatarian/flexitarian/other), suggesting moderate but not high prioritization of healthy eating. Qualitative notes (eating out, gardening, cycling) indicate some engagement with lifestyle and food, but not a strong health focus. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, with no upward demographic calibration (affluent, but not health-obsessed). The distribution is: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and robust V4 correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is now 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). Quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 5% vegetarian, and 33% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 59% eating meat. This suggests that while there is some openness to alternative diets, the majority are not strongly committed to restrictive healthy eating patterns. Qualitative notes (eating out, gardening) do not indicate a strong health focus. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, and no upward demographic calibration is warranted for this affluent segment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is set at 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). Quantitative evidence shows this affluent segment is overwhelmingly omnivorous (59% eat meat, only 1% vegan, 5% vegetarian, 33% pescatarian/flexitarian/other), suggesting healthy eating is not a dominant behavioral norm, but does not directly measure attitudes. Qualitative notes (eating out, gardening, cycling) suggest some health-consciousness but not a strong group identity around healthy eating. Therefore, the general V4 correction for 'Healthy Eating' is applied without upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class evidence and alignment with segment data.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.81
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run is clear and consistently references the V4 baseline for the attitude statement, which is appropriate given the available evidence. The demographic profile of 'Flourishing Capital' (older, affluent, semi-rural, nearing or in retirement) is well-matched to the concept, and the quantitative evidence (e.g., 15% plan to use other investments for retirement) is correctly interpreted as not contradicting the baseline. The qualitative notes reinforce the segment's likely sense of personal responsibility. The decision to apply the V4 baseline, with or without a modest demographic calibration, is well-argued and methodologically sound. No major evidence is overlooked, and the confidence level is appropriately high. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.40%
  Slightly agree: 35.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 17.80%
  Slightly disagree: 12.80%
  Strongly disagree: 8.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=27.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=17.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'). V4 baseline for this concept is 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 18% neither, 13% slightly disagree, 9% strongly disagree (60% agreement). For 'Flourishing Capital' (older, affluent, semi-rural, approaching/at retirement), a modest upward demographic calibration is warranted (+2pp to agreement, per V4: affluent/older). Quantitative evidence is limited but relevant: only 15% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting reliance on personal responsibility), and qualitative notes reinforce self-reliance. Therefore, I apply a +2pp calibration to agreement, yielding: SA 27%, A 36%, N 17%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to strong demographic fit and well-calibrated V4 baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is applied: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). This is supported by the demographic context: 'Flourishing Capital' are older, affluent, semi-rural couples nearing or in retirement, likely to have a strong sense of personal responsibility for retirement planning. Quantitative evidence is limited but not contradictory: only 15% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting most rely on traditional means, possibly pensions, but not that they reject personal responsibility). No evidence suggests a lower sense of responsibility than the general population. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, with no further demographic calibration needed (affluent/older, but V4 already corrects for over-prediction). Confidence is high due to strong alignment between concept, demographic, and available evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is an attitude item. V4 baseline for this concept is 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 18% neither, 13% slightly disagree, 9% strongly disagree (60% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3 due to mild over-prediction (+3pp) in prior rounds. 

Quantitative evidence: The closest direct evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (15%), which is low, but this measures behavior/plan, not attitude. The qualitative profile describes older, affluent, semi-rural couples nearing or in retirement, likely to have a sense of personal responsibility for retirement security, but also likely to have resources and planning in place. No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the V4 baseline for this concept. 

Demographic calibration: 'Flourishing Capital' is affluent and older, which would normally merit a +2pp adjustment, but V4 reduces demographic calibrations by 50%, so the baseline is retained. 

Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied with high confidence, as the evidence does not contradict it and the segment fits the typical profile for this attitude.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is used: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). This is supported by the segment's profile: affluent, older, semi-rural couples nearing or in retirement, who are likely to have a strong sense of personal responsibility for retirement planning. Quantitative evidence is limited but not contradictory: only 15% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting most rely on pensions or savings, not expecting external help), and 35% only save for a specific purpose (indicating some planning discipline). No evidence suggests unusually high or low agreement versus the general population, so no demographic calibration is applied. The result is a direct application of the V4 corrected baseline for this concept.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but closely aligns with 'identity' for this segment (older, affluent, semi-rural, approaching/at retirement). V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is 25/35/18/13/9 (60% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3. Quantitative evidence is limited but relevant: only 15% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting most expect to rely on pensions or state support), but this does not directly contradict a sense of personal responsibility. The qualitative profile (affluent, property-owning, nearing retirement) supports a higher-than-average sense of self-reliance, but V4 demographic calibration for 'Flourishing Capital' is only +2pp (down from +5pp in V3), so the baseline is appropriate. No strong evidence to deviate from the V4 template. Confidence is high due to strong concept fit and well-calibrated baseline.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 baseline for attitudes, which is appropriate given the concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') and the evidence provided. The quantitative data (high utility outgoings) is relevant but does not directly indicate switching behavior or strong attitudes toward switching, and the qualitative notes do not address utilities or switching at all. The decision not to apply further demographic calibration is well-supported by the V4 protocol and the lack of strong segment-specific evidence. The confidence is high due to the well-calibrated nature of the baseline and the careful, evidence-based reasoning in each run. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 baseline for attitudes is used: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The provided segment (Flourishing Capital) is affluent and likely to be more proactive with financial matters, but the evidence is mixed: high outgoings on utilities/council tax, but no direct evidence of high switching rates or strong attitudes toward switching. The quantitative evidence (utility spend) suggests engagement with utilities, but not necessarily a strong positive or negative attitude toward switching. Qualitative notes do not mention utilities or switching. Therefore, I keep the V4 attitude baseline, with a slight nudge toward 'disagree' (D) due to the lack of direct evidence for strong agreement, and the affluent segment may be less price-sensitive or less motivated to switch. This results in a modestly higher 'disagree' and 'neither' share, and slightly lower 'agree' than the pure baseline. Confidence is high due to strong segment match and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 baseline for this is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement). The segment (Flourishing Capital) shows high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related bills, which could slightly increase engagement with utility switching, but the evidence is not strong enough to warrant a demographic calibration (which is now reduced in V4). The quantitative evidence (high utility spend) is relevant but not directly tied to switching behavior, and the qualitative notes do not indicate a strong attitude toward switching. Therefore, the general V4 baseline for this attitude is applied without adjustment. Confidence is high due to the well-calibrated nature of this concept in V3/V4 and the lack of strong segment-specific evidence to shift the baseline.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this item is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related bills, which might slightly increase engagement with the topic, but not enough to warrant deviation from the baseline. Qualitative notes do not indicate unusually high or low friction or salience for switching utilities. Therefore, the general attitude baseline is appropriate for this affluent segment, with no demographic calibration needed. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is an attitude item. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated (V3 error: -2.1pp), so the baseline template is retained: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. 

Segment evidence: The quantitative data shows high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related bills (value=4760.76), suggesting that utilities are a significant expense for this affluent segment (Flourishing Capital). However, there is no direct evidence of high switching behavior or strong attitudes toward switching. The qualitative notes focus on leisure activities, not financial behaviors. 

Demographic calibration: This is an affluent segment, but V4 reduces demographic calibration by 50% (was +5pp, now +2pp for high income). However, since the concept is well-calibrated and the evidence does not strongly indicate higher agreement, no further upward adjustment is warranted. 

Therefore, the V4 baseline is used, with high confidence due to the well-calibrated nature of this concept and lack of strong segment-specific evidence to shift the distribution.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is an attitude item. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence shows this affluent segment ('Flourishing Capital') has high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related bills, which could slightly increase engagement with utility switching, but the V4 protocol maintains the general baseline for this concept due to its well-calibrated status. Qualitative notes do not indicate unusually high or low friction or engagement with utilities. Therefore, the standard distribution is applied with high confidence.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.80
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references strong quantitative evidence of high online purchase rates across multiple product categories for the 'Flourishing Capital' segment, indicating a digital-first orientation and a likely lower-than-average preference for cash. The qualitative note about ethical values is correctly identified as not directly relevant to cash preference. The V4 baseline is appropriately applied, with no demographic calibration warranted given the segment's affluence and digital engagement. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the reasoning is methodologically sound. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 24.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude'. V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is 13% strongly agree, 24% slightly agree, 28% neither, 22% slightly disagree, 13% strongly disagree (37% agreement). Quantitative evidence shows relatively high online purchase rates for this affluent segment (e.g., 56% for home appliances, 72% for holidays), suggesting a lower-than-average preference for cash. However, the V4 correction for this concept is only -3pp from V3, and the segment is affluent (Flourishing Capital), so demographic calibration would be minimal (+2pp at most, but V4 says only apply if strong evidence). The qualitative note about ethical values does not directly affect cash preference. Therefore, the general V4 baseline for this concept is appropriate, with no further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence on digital purchasing behavior.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For the 'Flourishing Capital' segment, the quantitative evidence shows relatively high online purchase rates for most categories (e.g., 56% for home appliances, 72% for holidays), and even for lower-frequency categories like alcohol and pet care, online rates are 26% and 34%. This suggests a segment comfortable with digital transactions and less reliant on cash. The qualitative note about preferring companies with strong ethical values does not directly indicate a preference for cash. Applying the V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' (SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13%), and considering the segment's digital orientation, no upward demographic calibration is warranted. The distribution is therefore kept at the V4 baseline, reflecting moderate agreement but a substantial portion neutral or disagreeing. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For the 'Flourishing Capital' segment, the quantitative evidence shows high online purchase rates for higher-value or less frequent items (home appliances: 56%, holiday/travel: 72%), and lower for everyday items (alcoholic drinks: 26%, pet care: 34%). This suggests a moderate-to-low preference for cash, especially for larger purchases, but possibly some cash use for smaller, everyday items. The qualitative note ('want to purchase from companies with strong ethical values') does not directly indicate a cash preference, but may suggest openness to digital or ethical payment methods. According to the V4 baseline for this concept (SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13%), and given the segment's affluence and digital engagement, no upward or downward demographic calibration is needed. The evidence hierarchy is led by direct quantitative data (online purchase rates), which supports a moderate-to-low cash preference. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate and well-supported.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude' (moderate spread). V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is 13/24/28/22/13 (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate but not high preference for cash. Quantitative evidence shows relatively high online purchase rates for this affluent segment (e.g., 56% for home appliances, 72% for holidays), indicating a digital-first orientation and likely lower cash preference. However, the item is an attitude, not a behavior, so some may still express a liking for cash even if they rarely use it. Qualitative evidence ('want to purchase from companies with strong ethical values') does not directly affect cash preference. No strong demographic calibration is needed (affluent, digital segment), so the V4 baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and well-calibrated V4 template.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude'. V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting moderate agreement and a broad spread. Quantitative evidence shows relatively high online purchase rates for this affluent segment (e.g., 56% for home appliances, 72% for holidays), suggesting a lower preference for cash than average, but not extremely low (since some categories like alcohol and pet care are lower, at 26% and 34%). Qualitative note about ethical values does not directly affect cash preference. No strong evidence to deviate from the V4 baseline, so the standard distribution is applied. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quant evidence on online behavior, but not directly about cash.
