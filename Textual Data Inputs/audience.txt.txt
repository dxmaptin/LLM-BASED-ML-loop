Young Dependents Segment Description A good proportion of these relatively well-off young adults still live with their parents as they are often full time students and thus their own earnings are generally low. Those who have moved out of home will probably have had some monetary support from their parents to be able to do so. Their use of financial services is fairly narrow, typically only using current accounts and commoditised (unregulated) financial products, such as travel insurance. They have grown up using the internet and will be mobile-first early adopters of digital platforms, reflected in their likelihood to have a current account with one of the neo-challenger banks. Most will have started to save and some will have been able to put aside a good level of savings. Their ease in using digital channels and platforms is reflected in above average levels involved in cryptocurrencies, being one of the most likely segments to invest using this method.

Starting Out Segment Description Young, single sharers form the majority of this segment. Having left the family home, this segment are learning to stand on their own feet for the first time and therefore sometimes find themselves struggling to make ends meet financially. They tend to live in flats or terraced houses, often renting privately but sometimes from a housing association or local authority. The personal income of people in this segment is often below the national average and few will have saved more than a few hundred pounds - although a small number might have a good level of savings. Like other young people, if they are not opening a financial product online they often look to arrange new products in branch, probably due to a combination of financial confidence and their limited financial history. Once they have accounts they are more likely to manage them online, often using their smartphone to do so.

Rising Metropolitans Segment Description These singles and couples are mostly aged under 35 and live in London and other major conurbations, often in areas of high property prices. Most rent from a private landlord but will be looking to get a deposit together for a property, and some will have been able to get on the housing ladder and therefore have a mortgage. Mainly working as professionals and in white collar occupations, a high proportion of these people are graduates. Incomes are typically well above the national average even though these people are earlier in their careers. Their jobs will often offer private healthcare and a number will have begun contributing to a company pension, however with high outgoings from rent and aspirational lifestyles, this segment are also more likely than average to have loans. As we might expect from the age group and affluence of this segment, they have smartphones and spend more time than most online. Being computer savvy and time poor, this segment both manage and arrange products online where possible. Their confidence in digital channels is reflected in the proportion investing in cryptocurrencies, or using peer to peer lending sites, being above the average.

Constrained Parents
Segment Description
Many in this segment are single parents with children. As a result there are more women than men amongst these parents and they are likely to be just about making ends meet financially. They typically live in social housing which may be terraced, semi-detached houses or flats, in areas where the housing is generally of low to average value.
Incomes are well below average, with a significant minority working part time and use of a loan will likely be more through need rather than as a planned way to buy something. Less than a third will have a credit card (not perhaps because they don’t want one, but because they can’t pass credit scoring) and those that do are less likely to pay off the full balance regularly. They are less likely than average to have insurance, but for those who do buy insurance, they will be more likely to use online channels or a price comparison site. They will spend time online using auction sites such as eBay, researching where to get the best price and are happy to make purchases through their smartphone.

Families Juggling Finances
Segment Description
These individuals aged 25–44 will typically have a mortgage, but with a good proportion privately renting, and the houses they live in are typically of below average value. Any children in the household are more likely to be of primary or junior school-age. Income levels are around or just below the average and most are coping, but a change in their financial circumstances could see them start to struggle. Whilst a good number have some savings, these households typically have a lower level of disposable income, and so any purchases of significant value might see the use of a loan or credit card to help them manage the payments. They are also above users of their overdraft facilities. Levels of insurance are typically around or just above the average.
They are comfortable setting up simpler products, such as general insurance or credit cards, through digital channels, including price comparison sites, and will prefer to actively manage their current account online. For arranging more considered products, they may prefer to speak to someone over the phone or in branch.

Secure Homeowners
Segment Description

Their incomes are generally well above the average. Many have a good level of savings and investments. Whilst they are earning a good salary, the proportion borrowing is above the average and this may reflect the outgoings associated with their children or to fund larger purchases such as home improvements or a new car. This segment has a high take up of life and income protection policies, and planning for retirement is also important to them, with many paying into a pension or thinking of using other investments to pay for their retirement, for example by investing in a buy to let property or property development.
