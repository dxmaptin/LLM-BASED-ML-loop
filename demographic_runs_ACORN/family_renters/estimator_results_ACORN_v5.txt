### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.77
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The topline percentages for agreement/disagreement are based on a generic attitude baseline, which is appropriate since the concept is only labeled as 'attitude' with no further specifics. The quantitative evidence (e.g., low rates of managing or arranging accounts by phone, low representation from 'Rest of Europe' and 'Other' countries of birth) is not directly relevant to a specific attitude and does not contradict the use of the generic baseline. The rationale for each run is consistent and methodologically sound, with appropriate confidence levels given the lack of direct evidence. No revision is needed unless more specific concept detail becomes available.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept is labeled as 'attitude' with no further specifics, so I must default to the most conservative semantic category. The evidence provided is not directly relevant to a specific attitude but rather gives some demographic and behavioral context (e.g., low rates of managing or arranging accounts by phone, low representation from 'Rest of Europe' and 'Other' countries of birth). None of these suggest a strong cost-consciousness, self-reliance, or other high-agreement category. Therefore, I assign this to the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' or generic attitude category, which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). No evidence justifies deviation from this baseline. Confidence is moderate because the category is generic and the evidence is only weakly relevant.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is labeled only as 'Concept' with no further detail, but the item type is 'attitude.' In the absence of specific content, the most conservative and generalizable approach is to use the 'Generic Attitude' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~35% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account by phone' at 12%, 'Arrange current account by phone' at 3%) is low and not directly relevant to a generic attitude, but it does not contradict the baseline. No strong demographic or behavioral evidence is present to warrant calibration. Confidence is moderate-high due to the generic nature of the concept and the lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is labeled as 'attitude' but lacks further detail, so the default is to classify it as a generic attitude unless more context is provided. The quantitative evidence provided relates to behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging current accounts by phone) and demographic splits, but none are directly relevant to a specific attitude statement. Therefore, the semantic category is 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' or generic attitude, both of which baseline at ~30% agreement (SA+A). No evidence suggests this is a cost-consciousness, self-reliance, or expensive purchase item. The evidence on 'manage by phone' (12%) and 'arrange by phone' (3%) are low, suggesting low behavioral uptake, which supports a conservative estimate. Thus, the baseline for generic attitude is used: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is moderate-high due to lack of direct evidence but strong category fit.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is labeled as 'attitude' with no further detail, so the default is to classify it as a generic attitude unless more context is provided. The quantitative evidence provided relates to behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging accounts by phone) and demographic splits, but none are directly relevant to a specific attitude concept (all relevance <0.8 except for a demographic split). Therefore, the semantic category is 'Generic Attitude' (baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). No evidence strongly overrides this baseline. The confidence is moderate-high because the evidence does not contradict the baseline, but the lack of concept detail limits certainty.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target is labeled as 'attitude' with no further context, so I must use the default semantic category decision tree. With no evidence of cost-saving, self-reliance, debt, health, or payment method, and no indication of expensive purchase or effort, this falls into the generic 'attitude' category (baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided is about current account management by phone (12% manage, 3% arrange), but these are behaviors, not attitudes, and their relevance is below the 0.8 override threshold. No demographic calibration is triggered. Thus, I use the generic attitude baseline. Confidence is moderate-high due to lack of specific context but strong category fit.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references directly relevant quantitative evidence: very low self-identification as environmentalists (7%) and low distrust of energy companies (26%), both indicating weak pro-environmental attitudes. The semantic category baseline ('Environmental Virtue Signaling') is appropriately applied, and the evidence is used to justify slight downward adjustments from the baseline. There is no evidence of stronger environmental engagement that would warrant higher agreement. The run-level detail shows careful calibration and consistency across iterations. No major qualitative evidence is missing that would contradict the quantitative findings. The justification is clear, methodologically sound, and confidence is high.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 7.80%
  Slightly agree: 21.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 16.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows very low self-identification as environmentalists (7%) and low distrust of energy companies on environmental grounds (26%), both indicating weak pro-environmental attitudes. There is no evidence of strong environmental engagement or concern in this group. Therefore, the baseline is not increased, and if anything, the evidence supports the lower end of the category. No demographic calibration is warranted as the evidence is directly relevant and overrides generic adjustments. The distribution maintains the expected attitudinal split for this type of question and audience.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=20.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events') is an environmental attitude, not a behavior, so it fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category (baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows very low agreement with environmentalist identity (7%) and low agreement that energy companies don't care about the environment (26%), both indicating weak environmental concern in this group. This supports using the lower end of the baseline. No evidence suggests higher agreement. Therefore, the estimate is slightly more negative than the baseline: SA 8%, A 20%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 17%. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=21.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). The quantitative evidence for this segment (family renters) shows very low agreement with environmental identity (only 7% consider themselves environmentalists) and low distrust of energy companies (26%), both indicating weak environmental concern. No evidence suggests higher agreement. Therefore, I slightly lower the baseline agreement and increase disagreement. The final estimate is: SA 7%, A 21%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 17%. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). The quantitative evidence from this segment shows very low self-identification as environmentalists (7%) and low agreement that energy companies do not care about the environment (26%), both indicating weak environmental concern in this group. There is no evidence of strong pro-environmental attitudes or behaviors. Therefore, the baseline is not adjusted upward. Demographic calibrations (family renters) do not suggest a significant shift. The distribution is kept at the category baseline, with high confidence due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=20.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events') is an environmental attitude, not a behavior. According to the learned semantic categories, this falls under 'Environmental Virtue Signaling', which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). The quantitative evidence from this segment shows very low agreement with environmental identity (only 7% consider themselves environmentalists) and low-moderate agreement with anti-corporate environmental attitudes (26% think energy companies don't care about the environment). This suggests even lower agreement than the already-low baseline. No evidence suggests higher engagement or concern. Therefore, I slightly reduce the 'slightly agree' and increase disagreement compared to the baseline. The distribution reflects a skeptical, disengaged segment with little environmental identification. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for agreement with 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is well justified. The rationale consistently references highly relevant quantitative evidence (93% of outgoings on housing/utilities), which directly supports the salience of energy-saving behaviors for this segment. The repeated alignment with the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' category baseline (~70% agreement) is appropriate, and the demographic calibration for family renters is reasonable given their likely budget sensitivity. The lack of contradictory evidence from digital or attitudinal measures is correctly noted. The rationale is clear, evidence-based, and the confidence in the estimate is warranted. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 31.60%
  Slightly agree: 39.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 14.20%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving on utility bills is a universal, low-effort, high-impact behavior. The quantitative evidence shows that this segment (family renters) spends heavily on housing and utilities (93.3% relevance), reinforcing the salience of energy costs in their lives. There is no evidence of strong digital or environmental attitudes, but the cost-saving motive dominates. No demographic calibration is needed as renters are typically cost-sensitive. The evidence supports the high baseline, so the estimate remains at 70% agreement (30% strongly agree, 40% slightly agree).
Run 2: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving on utility bills is a universal priority, especially for renters and families with high outgoings (as shown by the 93% spending on housing/utilities). No direct quantitative evidence contradicts this, and the segment's low agreement with digital/tech attitudes does not affect cost-saving behaviors. Demographic calibration for 'family renters' (likely to be budget-conscious) supports the high baseline. Therefore, the estimate is slightly above the category baseline, with a strong skew toward agreement.
Run 3: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is a classic 'Cost-Consciousness Behavior'—a category with very high agreement (baseline ~70%) because saving on utility bills is a universal motivator, especially for renters and families with high housing/utility outgoings (quantitative evidence: 93% have significant outgoings in this area). There is no evidence of strong digital or environmental attitudes in this segment, but the cost-saving motive dominates. Demographic calibration: Family renters are likely to be budget-conscious, so the baseline is appropriate. Quantitative evidence is highly relevant and supports the high agreement estimate. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is a classic 'cost-consciousness behavior'—it saves money with minimal effort, which is highly universal, especially for renters who are likely to be budget-sensitive. The quantitative evidence shows that 93% of outgoings are on housing and utilities, indicating that this is a major expense and thus a strong motivator for energy-saving behaviors. There is no direct evidence contradicting this, and the segment's digital/financial attitudes are not directly relevant. The baseline for cost-consciousness behaviors is 70% agreement (SA 30%, A 40%), and the demographic (family renters) likely skews slightly higher due to financial pressure, so a small upward calibration is applied. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving on utility bills is a universal concern, especially for renters and families with high housing and utility outgoings (quantitative evidence: 93% report significant spend on housing/utilities). No evidence suggests unusually low motivation or barriers for this segment. Demographic calibration: Family renters may be slightly more motivated than average due to budget constraints, but not enough to shift the baseline significantly. No strong evidence of digital or attitudinal factors that would reduce agreement. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline: Strongly agree 32%, Slightly agree 39%, Neither 14%, Slightly disagree 10%, Strongly disagree 5%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence ('environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 34%) and correctly notes the conceptual gap between this and the target concept ('fuel consumption is the most important feature'). The semantic category is appropriately identified as 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments', with a low baseline for agreement, and the restrictive 'most important' phrasing is properly accounted for. The demographic context (family renters) is considered but not over-weighted due to lack of strong evidence for higher agreement. The iterative runs show careful calibration, and the confidence is appropriately high given the available evidence. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 6.20%
  Slightly agree: 14.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 27.80%
  Slightly disagree: 29.40%
  Strongly disagree: 22.60%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=24.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, as it relates to a high-cost decision and prioritization of a specific feature. The closest quantitative evidence is the 34% agreement for 'environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' being important when buying a car, which is a related but not identical concept. Fuel consumption is a practical, cost-related feature, but the phrasing ('most important feature') is exclusive and likely to depress agreement, as buyers often consider multiple factors (price, reliability, brand, etc.). The baseline for this category is low (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). The evidence for environmental concern is slightly higher (34%), but this is for 'important' not 'most important', and environmental concern is generally lower than cost concern for this segment. No strong demographic calibration is warranted for 'family renters'. Therefore, I keep the baseline, but nudge agreement up slightly to reflect that fuel consumption is a more practical concern than environmental friendliness, but the 'most important' phrasing keeps agreement low. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: This concept fits 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' (category 5, ~15% agreement baseline) because it asks about the most important feature when buying a new car—a high-cost, infrequent purchase where priorities are highly varied and cost barriers are significant. Quantitative evidence: The closest direct evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.34), which is a related but less universally prioritized feature than fuel consumption. However, even this only reaches 34% agreement, and fuel consumption, while practical, competes with other priorities (price, reliability, brand, etc.). No evidence suggests fuel consumption is overwhelmingly the top priority for this segment. Demographic calibration: Family renters may be more price-sensitive, but the evidence does not indicate a strong consensus. Therefore, the estimate is slightly above the baseline for agreement (6% SA, 13% A = 19% agreement), with a large plurality in the neutral/disagree categories, reflecting the diversity of priorities in car buying.
Run 3: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' is about prioritizing a specific (cost-related) feature in a high-cost purchase context. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.34), which is conceptually related but not identical—environmental concern is typically lower than cost concern, but both are secondary to price, reliability, and brand for most buyers. The baseline for Expensive Purchases is low (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%), reflecting that few people cite a single feature as 'most important' in a major purchase. The evidence (0.34) is slightly above the baseline but still low, so I nudge agreement up a bit (SA 7%, A 18%) and reduce strong disagreement slightly. Demographic calibration: Family renters may be more price-sensitive, but the 'most important' framing is restrictive, so agreement remains low. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear semantic fit.
Run 4: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' is about prioritizing a single (cost-related) feature in a high-cost purchase context. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.34), which is a related but not identical concept—environmental concern is typically lower than cost concern, but both are secondary to price, reliability, and brand for most buyers. The baseline for Expensive Purchases is low (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). The evidence (0.34) suggests a slightly higher agreement than baseline, but since 'fuel consumption' is cost-related (not environmental), it may be somewhat more salient for this segment (family renters, likely budget-conscious), but still not the top priority for most. Calibrating slightly upward from baseline, but not above 20% agreement. No strong demographic evidence to push higher. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchor and clear semantic fit.
Run 5: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments (~15% agreement). The statement 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' is about prioritizing a specific (cost-related) feature in a high-cost purchase context. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.34), which is slightly higher but still low, and this is for a virtue-signaling environmental feature, not cost-saving per se. The baseline for expensive purchases is low (SA 3%, A 12%), and the evidence suggests only a modest increase for fuel consumption, as it is a practical concern but rarely the single most important factor. The audience (family renters) may be cost-conscious, but the evidence does not support a much higher agreement. Therefore, the estimate is: SA 6%, A 13%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 23%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear semantic fit.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for agreement with 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified based on the evidence provided. The topline quantitative data directly addresses risk aversion ('I do not mind taking risks with my money' at 20% agreement), which is highly relevant to debt aversion. The repeated rationale across runs consistently links the risk aversion evidence to the debt aversion estimate, and the segment profile (family renters) is considered but not over-interpreted in the absence of stronger demographic cues. The qualitative evidence is acknowledged but not over-weighted due to lower relevance. The estimate maintains the category baseline, which is appropriate given the evidence. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 12.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 20% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting risk aversion is common), and only 22% agree that 'climate change is the biggest threat to civilisation' (showing generally low agreement rates in this segment). The segment is 'family renters', who are often younger and may have more exposure to debt but also more anxiety about it, so the baseline is appropriate. No strong evidence to shift the baseline up or down. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence on risk aversion.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 20% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting risk aversion is common), and the segment shows low agreement with progressive or risk-tolerant attitudes (e.g., 22% for climate change threat, 25% likely to move). There is no evidence of unusually high or low debt aversion in this segment, so the category baseline is appropriate. Demographic calibrations are not applied due to lack of specific cues. Confidence is high due to strong relevance of the risk attitude evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~43% (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 20% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting a risk-averse, debt-averse profile), and only 22% agree that 'climate change is the biggest threat to civilisation' (showing generally low agreement rates in this segment). The segment is 'family renters', who are often younger and may have lower income, but the evidence does not suggest a strong deviation from the baseline. No evidence suggests higher or lower debt aversion than the general population. Therefore, the baseline is maintained, with a moderate confidence due to strong relevance of the risk attitude evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 20% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting risk aversion is common), and only 22% agree that 'climate change is the biggest threat to civilisation' (showing generally moderate agreement levels in this segment). There is no evidence of unusually high or low debt aversion in this group, so the category baseline is appropriate. Demographic calibrations are not applied due to lack of strong evidence for deviation. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 20% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting a risk-averse, debt-averse profile), and only 22% agree that 'climate change is the biggest threat to civilisation' (showing moderate agreement with strong attitudes). The segment (family renters) is likely to be more exposed to debt but also more wary of it due to financial insecurity, so the baseline is appropriate. No strong demographic calibration is needed. The evidence is highly relevant (relevance >0.9), so the category baseline is maintained. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.78
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I am very good at managing money' is sufficiently justified given the evidence and the reasoning provided. The runs consistently reference the semantic category ('Self-Reliance Identity'), which is known to attract high agreement due to social desirability bias. The quantitative evidence (online savings management, miscellaneous spending, car ownership) is appropriately interpreted as not directly measuring self-assessed money management skill, but as providing context for financial behaviors. The rationale correctly notes that self-perception is often more positive than objective behaviors would suggest, and that no strong contradictory evidence is present. The slight adjustment in Run 4 for demographic calibration is reasonable, though not strictly necessary given the lack of strong evidence for lower self-confidence in this group. Overall, the justification is methodologically sound and the estimate is well-grounded in the evidence provided.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 24.80%
  Slightly agree: 34.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.20%
  Strongly disagree: 8.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') is a self-reliance identity statement. According to the learned semantic categories, these statements typically have high agreement due to social desirability and positive self-concept, with a baseline of 60% agreement (SA 25%, A 35%). The quantitative evidence does not directly measure self-assessed money management skill, but the low rate of online savings account management (21%) suggests some digital or financial confidence gaps, while high private car ownership (78%) and moderate miscellaneous spending (38.8%) indicate a degree of financial activity and responsibility. No evidence strongly contradicts the baseline, so the category baseline is retained. Demographic calibration for 'family renters' (likely younger, possibly lower income) does not significantly shift the baseline for this identity statement. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees moderate-to-high agreement (baseline: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%). This is due to social desirability bias and the tendency for people to view themselves as competent in personal finance, even if objective behaviors may not fully support this. The quantitative evidence provided does not directly measure self-assessed money management skill, but the relatively low rate of online savings account management (21%) and high miscellaneous spending (38.8%) suggest some behavioral gaps. However, these do not strongly contradict the self-perception, as self-reported competence is usually higher than actual prudent behavior. No strong demographic calibration is warranted for this segment (family renters), so the baseline is used. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a positive self-assessment of competence, and such statements are generally inflated by social desirability bias. The quantitative evidence does not directly measure self-assessed money management skill, but the relatively low rate of online savings management (21%) and high miscellaneous spending (38.8% of outgoings) suggest only moderate financial sophistication and discipline in this segment. However, the high rate of private car ownership (78%) may indicate some financial stability. No evidence suggests a need to deviate significantly from the category baseline. Therefore, the estimate remains close to the baseline: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=24.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement due to positive self-concept and social desirability bias. The segment (ACORN family renters) shows moderate online savings management (21%), suggesting some digital engagement but not universally high financial confidence. Outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services are moderate, and car ownership is relatively high (78%), indicating some financial stability. No direct evidence contradicts the baseline, so the estimate is close to the category norm, with a slight downward adjustment for this segment's likely younger, less affluent profile (family renters), who may have less financial experience/confidence than older or higher-income groups. Thus, agreement is estimated at 58% (24% strongly agree, 34% slightly agree), with 22% disagreement and 20% neutral. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees moderate-to-high agreement (baseline: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%). This is because people tend to rate themselves positively on competence and responsibility, especially for socially desirable traits like money management. The quantitative evidence does not directly measure self-assessed money management skill, but the relatively low rate of online savings account management (21%) suggests some digital or financial confidence gaps, though this is more about channel than self-perception. The high rate of private car ownership (78%) and significant miscellaneous spending (38.8%) indicate some financial capacity and normal consumption patterns, but do not directly contradict the baseline. No evidence suggests a need to adjust the baseline for this segment. Therefore, the baseline distribution for self-reliance identity is applied with moderate confidence.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the most relevant quantitative evidence ('fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', value=0.15, relevance=0.98) as a proxy for attitudes toward high-cost, risk-averse commitments, which is methodologically sound. The semantic category baseline is clearly stated and appropriately used. Demographic and qualitative context is considered, with no evidence found to warrant deviation from the baseline. The repeated alignment across runs and the explicit reasoning for not increasing agreement due to price sensitivity and mass-market orientation further strengthen the justification. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.80%
  Slightly agree: 11.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 27.80%
  Slightly disagree: 31.80%
  Strongly disagree: 24.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=24.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'It is important to be well insured for everything' involves a high-cost, comprehensive financial commitment, which typically sees low agreement due to cost barriers and lack of universal priority. The baseline for this category is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). Quantitative evidence from a highly relevant item ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', value=0.15, relevance=0.98) supports this low agreement pattern for expensive, risk-averse attitudes in this segment. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence suggests deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=24.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'It is important to be well insured for everything' requires a willingness to pay for comprehensive insurance, which is a high-cost, non-universal financial commitment. The baseline for this category is low agreement (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). Quantitative evidence from the segment shows low agreement for similar high-cost or risk-averse attitudes (e.g., 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' at 15%), supporting the low baseline. No evidence suggests this segment is unusually risk-averse or affluent, so no upward calibration is warranted. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between category and evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=11.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=31.00%, Strongly disagree=27.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'It is important to be well insured for everything' involves a high-cost, comprehensive financial commitment, which typically receives low agreement due to cost barriers and lack of universal priority. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.15), which is also a high-cost, risk-averse attitude and aligns with the low baseline for this category (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). No evidence suggests higher agreement. Demographic calibration for 'family renters' does not significantly increase agreement, as renters are often more price-sensitive and less likely to prioritize comprehensive insurance. Therefore, the estimate remains close to the category baseline, with a slight nudge toward more disagreement due to the segment's likely cost sensitivity.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which typically sees low agreement (~15%) due to the high cost and non-universality of comprehensive insurance. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.15, relevance=0.98), which is a similar high-cost, risk-averse attitude and confirms the low baseline. Other evidence (adverts, mass market clothing) is less relevant and does not suggest higher agreement. No demographic calibration is warranted as 'family renters' are not likely to over-index on expensive insurance priorities. Therefore, the baseline for this category (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%) is maintained, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=24.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'It is important to be well insured for everything' implies a willingness to pay for comprehensive insurance, which is a high-cost, non-universal financial commitment. The baseline for this category is low agreement (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). Quantitative evidence from the segment (e.g., only 15% agree that 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') suggests that this group is not highly focused on expensive, risk-averse behaviors, and is more mass-market oriented (51% shop mass market, indicating price sensitivity). No strong evidence to increase agreement above baseline. Demographic calibration for 'family renters' (likely lower-middle income, price sensitive) would, if anything, slightly reduce agreement with expensive insurance commitments. Therefore, the baseline is maintained. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The simulated survey predictions for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes among family renters are well-grounded in the provided quantitative evidence: very low rates of vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.2%) diets, moderate pescatarian/flexitarian/other (16.6%), and high meat consumption (78.5%). The rationale correctly interprets this as indicating moderate aspiration toward healthy eating, but limited actual adoption of restrictive or health-focused diets. The attitude-behavior gap is acknowledged, and the semantic category baseline is appropriately referenced. The repeated topline estimates are consistent and justified by the evidence, and the confidence is appropriately high given the direct relevance and strength of the quantitative data. No major demographic calibration is needed for this segment. No corrective feedback is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 11.60%
  Slightly agree: 25.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.40%
  Slightly disagree: 22.60%
  Strongly disagree: 14.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 17% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, while 78% eat meat. This indicates that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary behaviors are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. This supports the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~38% agreement (SA+A). The evidence suggests that while there is some aspiration, the majority do not practice or strongly endorse healthy eating, so the baseline is appropriate. No strong demographic calibration is needed for family renters. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 17% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, while 78% eat meat. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary behaviors are not strongly aligned with health-focused choices in this segment (family renters). This aligns with the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~38% agreement (SA+A). The strong quantitative evidence of low uptake of health-oriented diets justifies a slightly lower agreement than the baseline, so the estimate is: SA 10%, A 22%, N 28%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to the direct quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 17% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, while 78% eat meat. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. This fits the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category (baseline: 12% SA, 26% A, 26% N, 22% D, 14% SD). The evidence supports a moderate level of agreement, with a significant portion neutral or disagreeing, reflecting the attitude-behavior gap and the prevalence of meat-eating. No strong demographic calibration is needed as the segment is 'family renters', which is not strongly skewed toward health-consciousness. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence provided is about actual eating behaviors (very low vegan/vegetarian rates, high meat consumption). This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual adoption of plant-based diets is low in this segment (family renters). The semantic category is 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' (baseline: 12% SA, 26% A, 26% N, 22% D, 14% SD). The evidence (high meat, low vegan/vegetarian) supports the idea that agreement with healthy eating as an attitude is moderate, but not high, due to the attitude-behavior gap. No strong demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence provided is about actual eating behaviors (very low vegan/vegetarian rates, high meat consumption). This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual adoption of plant-based diets is low in this segment (family renters). According to the semantic category system, 'Healthy Eating' falls under 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' (baseline: 12% SA, 26% A, 26% N, 22% D, 14% SD). The evidence supports this moderate agreement: the high meat consumption and low vegan/vegetarian rates indicate that strong agreement is limited, but some aspiration remains. No major demographic calibration is needed, as the evidence is highly relevant (relevance >0.9). Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale clearly distinguishes between attitudinal and behavioral evidence, correctly noting that low behavioral intent (e.g., 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' at 0.13) does not directly contradict moderate-to-high agreement with a self-reliance attitude statement. The repeated reference to the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category and its typical baseline (~60% agreement) is appropriate, and the downward adjustment for the family renters segment is well reasoned given their likely lower financial security. The use of multiple runs with consistent logic and minor parameter variation demonstrates robustness. No strong contradictory evidence is present, and the confidence level is appropriately high. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 22.80%
  Slightly agree: 33.60%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 21.60%
  Slightly disagree: 13.20%
  Strongly disagree: 8.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees moderate-to-high agreement (baseline ~60%). This is a positive self-concept/competence statement, and social desirability bias tends to inflate agreement. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (0.13), which is much lower, but this measures actual planning/behavior, not attitude. Attitudinal evidence ('I only save for a specific purpose' 0.34, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' 0.32) are both lower, but these are about specific behaviors or effort, not broad self-reliance. No evidence directly contradicts the baseline for self-reliance attitudes. Family renters may be slightly less confident about retirement, but the attitudinal nature of the statement (not requiring action or resources) means agreement remains moderate. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=22.00%, Slightly agree=33.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=14.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees moderate-to-high agreement (~60%) due to social desirability and positive self-concept. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (0.13), which is low, but this measures actual planning/behavior, not attitude. Attitudinal evidence ('I only save for a specific purpose' 0.34, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' 0.32) is also moderate, but these are more about saving habits and effort than self-reliance identity. Given the segment (family renters), who may feel less secure and more exposed to financial risk, agreement is likely slightly below the general population baseline for self-reliance identity. Therefore, I adjust the baseline downward by ~5pp, resulting in ~55% agreement (22% strongly agree, 33% slightly agree), with a moderate neutral and disagreement share. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=22.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees moderate-to-high agreement (~60%) due to social desirability and positive self-concept. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (0.13), which is low, but this measures actual planning/behavior, not attitude. Attitudinal evidence ('I only save for a specific purpose' 0.34, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' 0.32) is also moderate, but these are more about behavior/effort than identity. Given the segment (family renters), who may feel less secure and less empowered than homeowners, I conservatively adjust the baseline downward by ~5pp. Thus, I estimate agreement at 56% (22% strongly, 34% slightly), with 22% neutral, and 22% disagree (13% slightly, 9% strongly). Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=22.00%, Slightly agree=33.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=14.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees moderate-to-high agreement (~60%) due to social desirability and positive self-concept. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (0.13), which is low, but this measures actual planning/behavior, not attitude. The attitude baseline for self-reliance is higher than for actual financial planning. Other evidence ('I only save for a specific purpose' 0.34, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' 0.32) suggests this segment is not highly proactive or effortful, but the core attitude of personal responsibility is likely to be higher than these behaviors. Therefore, I anchor slightly below the category baseline (60% agreement), at 55% agreement (22% strongly agree, 33% slightly agree), with a moderate neutral (22%) and the remainder split between disagreement. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=23.00%, Slightly agree=33.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees moderate-to-high agreement (~60%) due to social desirability and positive self-concept. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (0.13), which is low, but this measures behavior/intent, not attitude. The attitude item is more about personal responsibility, not actual planning. Other evidence ('I only save for a specific purpose' 0.34, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' 0.32) are tangential but suggest moderate self-reliance and effort aversion. No evidence strongly contradicts the baseline. For 'family renters', who may feel less institutional security, self-reliance attitudes may be slightly above average, but not dramatically so. Therefore, I use the Self-Reliance Identity baseline (SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%), with a slight downward adjustment for the low behavioral intent evidence, resulting in: SA 23%, A 33%, N 22%, D 13%, SD 9%.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category, which is appropriate for the concept of switching utilities suppliers. The quantitative evidence (high outgoings on utilities) is acknowledged as a potential motivator but is correctly not over-weighted, given the lack of direct evidence for high switching rates or enthusiasm in this segment. The qualitative context and category baseline are applied appropriately, and the confidence in the estimate is well-supported by the alignment between evidence and reasoning. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') is an attitude about a behavior that requires significant time and effort, rather than a simple cost-saving action. According to the learned semantic categories, this fits 'Effort-Required Behaviors' (~30% agreement baseline), because switching utilities is perceived as a hassle, even if it could save money. The segment (family renters) has high outgoings on utilities, which might slightly increase agreement, but the evidence does not suggest a strong culture of proactive switching (sporting events and places of worship attendance are low, suggesting limited community engagement or activism). No direct quantitative evidence overrides the baseline. Therefore, the estimate is close to the category baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category is characterized by actions that require significant time or effort, which typically see low agreement due to inertia and effort aversion, even if there is a potential cost-saving. The quantitative evidence shows that this segment (family renters) has substantial outgoings on utilities (over £3,000/year), which could motivate switching, but the baseline for effortful behaviors remains low (~30% agreement). No direct evidence suggests unusually high switching rates or enthusiasm for the effort involved. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant quantitative context.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, while switching suppliers can save money, it requires time and effort, and inertia is high. The quantitative evidence shows that this segment (family renters) has significant outgoings on utilities (over £3,000/year), which could motivate switching, but the baseline for effortful behaviors remains low due to effort aversion. No direct evidence suggests unusually high switching rates or attitudes in this group. Therefore, the baseline (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is used, with a slight upward nudge in confidence due to the high utility spend, but not enough to shift the category baseline. Confidence is high because the evidence aligns well with the learned pattern.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, while switching utilities can save money, it requires time, research, and administrative effort—barriers that deter many, especially renters who may have less control over utility contracts. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting cost sensitivity), but this does not override the effort aversion pattern. No direct evidence indicates high rates of switching or strong positive attitudes toward the effort involved. Therefore, the baseline (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is used, with no major demographic calibration since renters may be slightly more cost-conscious but also face more barriers to switching. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the effort-required behavior pattern and supporting evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, while switching can save money, it requires time, research, and administrative effort—barriers for many, especially renters and families with busy lives. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities, which could motivate switching, but the actual behavioral follow-through is typically low due to inertia and perceived hassle. No direct evidence suggests this segment is unusually proactive. Therefore, the baseline for effort-required behaviors (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified based on the evidence provided. The rationale consistently references the quantitative toplines, which show relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items among ACORN family renters, supporting a moderate preference for cash. The higher online rates for larger, less frequent purchases are correctly interpreted as not undermining the cash preference for routine transactions. The demographic calibration is reasonable, noting that family renters may skew younger and urban but are not highly affluent or digital, so no strong adjustment is warranted. The lack of strong qualitative evidence is acknowledged, and the estimate appropriately follows the semantic category baseline. The justification is methodologically sound and well-grounded in the evidence.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 24.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' falls under the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~37% agreement (SA 13%, A 24%). The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items among ACORN family renters (e.g., 19% for alcohol, 24% for pet care), suggesting a preference for in-person or traditional payment methods, which supports the baseline or possibly a slight upward adjustment. However, the rates for larger purchases (home appliances, holidays) are higher, indicating some digital adoption, but these are less frequent transactions. No strong qualitative evidence is provided to override this. Demographically, family renters may skew younger and urban, but the evidence does not justify a major deviation from the category baseline. Thus, the estimate closely follows the category pattern, with moderate confidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~37% agreement (SA 13%, A 24%). The quantitative evidence shows that this segment (ACORN family renters) has relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 19%, pet care 24%), but higher for larger/less frequent purchases (home appliances 52%, holiday/travel 54%). This suggests moderate digital adoption, but not a strong preference for online/digital payments for routine purchases, implying a moderate to slightly above average preference for cash. No qualitative evidence directly contradicts this. Demographically, family renters may skew younger and urban, but not affluent, so no strong calibration is needed. The baseline distribution is therefore appropriate, with moderate confidence due to strong relevance of the quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I like to use cash when making purchases') fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of 37% agreement (SA 13%, A 24%). The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items among ACORN family renters (e.g., 19% for alcohol, 24% for pet care), suggesting a preference for in-person and potentially cash transactions. This supports the baseline rather than lowering it. No evidence suggests a dramatic shift away from cash in this group. Demographic calibration: family renters may skew younger and urban, but not affluent, so no strong adjustment. Therefore, the baseline distribution is appropriate, with moderate confidence due to strong relevance of the online purchase evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' falls under the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~37% (SA 13%, A 24%). The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items among ACORN family renters (e.g., 19% for alcohol, 24% for pet care), suggesting a moderate preference for in-person or traditional payment methods, which supports the baseline. However, the rates for larger purchases (home appliances, holidays) are higher, indicating some digital adoption but not dominance. No strong qualitative evidence shifts this baseline. Demographically, family renters may skew younger and urban, which would slightly reduce cash preference, but the evidence is not strong enough to warrant a major adjustment. Thus, the baseline distribution is maintained, with moderate confidence due to strong quantitative relevance.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The target concept is an attitude about preferring cash for purchases. The quantitative evidence shows that for this segment (ACORN family renters), online purchasing rates are relatively low for everyday categories like alcohol (19%) and pet care (24%), and only moderate for higher-ticket items (home appliances 52%, holiday/travel 54%). This suggests a lower-than-average adoption of online payments, implying a moderate to slightly above-average preference for cash compared to the general population. The baseline for cash/payment preferences is 37% agreement (SA+A), and the evidence supports maintaining this baseline, as this segment is likely to be younger renters (not elderly, so no strong upward calibration for cash), but also not highly digital. No strong qualitative evidence to shift the baseline. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13%.
