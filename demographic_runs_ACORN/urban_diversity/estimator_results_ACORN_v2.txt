### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.62
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale for each run correctly identifies that the quantitative evidence pertains to behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging accounts by phone) and demographics (country of birth), which are not directly relevant to the attitudinal concept being estimated. The absence of direct attitudinal evidence or informative qualitative data is acknowledged, and the use of a conservative baseline template for attitudes is appropriate in this context. The confidence level is appropriately described as moderate due to the lack of direct evidence. No corrective action is needed; the approach is methodologically sound given the constraints.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the conservative baseline template is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about the target concept, only about behaviors (e.g., managing/arranging accounts by phone) and country of birth, which are not directly relevant to the attitude concept. The qualitative notes are not informative. No demographic calibration is warranted due to lack of strong evidence. Confidence is moderate due to reliance on the baseline template and absence of direct evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative attitude baseline is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence for related behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging current accounts by phone) shows low engagement (8-19%), but these are behavioral and not directly attitudinal, so they do not justify lowering the baseline further. No strong qualitative evidence is present. No demographic calibration is warranted as the evidence is not concept-specific. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct quantitative data for the attitude itself.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative attitude baseline is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about the target concept, only about related behaviors (e.g., managing/arranging accounts by phone) and demographics (country of birth). These values are all quite low (e.g., 2.5% for Rest of Europe, 8-19% for phone banking), but they pertain to specific behaviors, not general attitudes. No qualitative evidence is present. Since there is no strong evidence to adjust the baseline, and the system bias is to avoid over-prediction, the baseline is retained. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.55 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative attitude baseline is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about agreement with the target concept, and the retrieved quantitative data relates to behaviors (e.g., managing accounts by phone) and country of birth, which are not directly relevant to the attitude in question. No qualitative evidence is provided that would shift the baseline. Therefore, the default conservative attitude template is applied, with no demographic or concept-specific adjustments. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.60 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the conservative baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about the target concept, but the closest quantitative data (e.g., 'Manage current account by phone' at 19%, 'Arrange current account by phone' at 8%) suggest relatively low engagement or agreement with related behaviors in this segment. No qualitative evidence is present to shift the baseline. No demographic calibration is warranted as the evidence does not indicate a strong deviation from the baseline. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence, but the baseline is appropriate given the context.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the evidence hierarchy, giving dominant weight to the direct quantitative data (8% self-identifying as environmentalist, 29% agreeing energy companies don't care about the environment). The predicted agreement rates (SA+A around 15-17%) are appropriately lower than the generic attitude baseline, reflecting the segment's low pro-environmental sentiment. The distribution is shifted toward disagreement and neutrality, which is well-supported by the evidence. Confidence is high due to the strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence and clear, consistent reasoning across runs. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 4.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 30.80%
  Strongly disagree: 25.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.93 / Rationale: This is an attitude item, but direct quantitative evidence shows extremely low agreement with environmentalist identity (8%) and low agreement that energy companies don't care about the environment (29%). There is no evidence of strong pro-environmental sentiment in this segment. The baseline for attitude items is already conservative (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%), but the direct evidence (8% agreement with 'I consider myself an environmentalist') justifies pushing agreement even lower and increasing disagreement. Therefore, I allocate only 4% to strongly agree and 13% to slightly agree, with a majority split between neither (28%), slightly disagree (30%), and strongly disagree (25%). This matches the evidence hierarchy: direct quantitative data (80% weight) overrides any generic attitude baseline or qualitative hints. Confidence is high due to the strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: This is an attitude item, but the most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low: only 8% of this segment consider themselves environmentalists (file=ACORN_urban_diversity.csv, relevance=0.98). Agreement that 'energy companies do not care about the environment' is also low (29%), suggesting skepticism or disengagement with environmental narratives. There is no direct evidence of strong pro-environmental attitudes in this group. The baseline for attitude items is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%, but the direct quantitative evidence (8% environmentalist) is much lower, so the agreement rates must be reduced substantially. Following the evidence hierarchy, I weight the direct quantitative data at 80%, so I set total agreement (SA+A) at 17% (slightly above the 8% environmentalist figure, to allow for some who agree with the statement but don't self-identify as environmentalist). Disagreement is increased accordingly, and variance is pushed further from the mean to reflect the low baseline. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=11.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events. The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low agreement with environmentalist identity (8%) and low agreement that energy companies don't care about the environment (29%). There is no direct evidence of strong pro-environmental attitudes in this segment (urban diversity). The baseline for attitude items is already conservative (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%), but the direct evidence (8% agreement with 'I consider myself an environmentalist') is much lower, so the prediction must be pushed even lower, with most respondents likely to disagree or be neutral. The distribution is therefore shifted heavily toward disagreement and neutrality, with only a small minority agreeing. This matches the evidence hierarchy: direct quantitative data (8%) is weighted most heavily, so agreement is predicted to be very low. Confidence is high due to the strong, direct quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=26.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: 1. Concept type: This is an attitude question, so the baseline would be Attitude (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%).
2. Quantitative evidence: The direct data for 'I consider myself an environmentalist' is extremely low (8%), and 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' is also low (29%). This indicates low environmental concern in this segment. According to the evidence hierarchy, this quantitative data should dominate the prediction.
3. Demographic calibration: The segment is 'urban diversity', but the direct evidence of low environmental self-identification outweighs any assumption about urban/progressive attitudes.
4. Variance: Given the very low agreement on environmentalism, the prediction should be pushed much lower than the baseline, with a majority disagreeing or neutral.
5. Final adjustment: Strongly agree and slightly agree are set very low (4% and 12%), with a large portion in neither/disagree, and a substantial strongly disagree (26%).
Confidence is high due to strong, direct quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=11.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events. The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low agreement with 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (8%) and low agreement with 'energy companies do not care about the environment' (29%). There is no evidence of strong pro-environmental attitudes in this segment. According to the evidence hierarchy, the direct quantitative data (8% agreement) should dominate, so the prediction must be much lower than the attitude baseline (which would be 10/25/30/20/15). Given the segment's low environmental self-identification, even a general statement about brands and sustainability will not elicit high agreement. Therefore, the distribution is shifted heavily toward disagreement, with only a small minority agreeing. The variance is increased to reflect the strong evidence of low agreement. Confidence is high due to the direct quantitative match.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.81
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V2 concept-specific correction, which is appropriate given the known under-prediction for this item. Quantitative evidence (high outgoings on utilities) supports the plausibility of cost-consciousness, and there is no contradictory evidence from related attitudes or digital engagement. The lack of qualitative evidence is acknowledged, but does not undermine the use of the template correction. The repeated application of the correction across runs, with clear reasoning and no evidence to suggest a different approach, supports a high-confidence assessment. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 8.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is an attitude item. According to the V2 guidelines, this specific concept is known to be under-predicted and should use the concept-specific correction: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Quantitative evidence for this segment shows moderate digital engagement (chatbot ease 37%, computer confusion 16%), but no direct evidence contradicts the template. Outgoings on utilities are high, which may reinforce the likelihood of cost-consciousness and efforts to reduce usage. No qualitative evidence is available to override the quantitative or template-based prediction. Therefore, the concept-specific correction is applied directly, with high confidence due to the strong evidence base for this correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The item is an attitude statement about making an effort to cut down on gas/electricity at home. The V2 prompt specifies a concept-specific correction for this item: previous predictions under-estimated agreement by 21pp, so the template is SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Quantitative evidence from the segment shows relatively high outgoings on housing/utilities (value=109.83), but no direct evidence of energy-saving attitudes. The closest attitude item ('I make an effort to support local businesses') is low (0.15), but this is not directly related. There is no evidence of strong digital confusion (0.16) or chatbot enthusiasm (0.37) that would suggest high or low engagement with energy-saving. Therefore, the concept-specific correction is applied directly, with no further demographic or evidence-based adjustment. Confidence is high due to the direct template match and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-friction behavior but, per V2 guidance, is known to be under-predicted (actual agreement is higher than baseline). The segment is 'urban diversity', with moderate outgoings on utilities (value=109.83), suggesting average to slightly above-average energy costs. Quantitative evidence for similar attitude items in this segment is low (e.g., only 14.6% agree with 'I make an effort to support local businesses'), but this is not directly comparable: cost-saving behaviors tend to have higher agreement than pro-social attitudes. Per the concept-specific correction, the template for this item is SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. No direct quantitative evidence overrides this, and qualitative evidence is absent. Demographic calibration is not applied as there is no strong signal for low-income or cost-stressed status. Confidence is high due to the strong concept-specific correction and lack of conflicting evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-friction behavior but, per V2 guidance, is a known exception where agreement is under-predicted (actuals are higher than baseline). The concept-specific correction for this item is: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Quantitative evidence for this segment shows moderate digital engagement (chatbot ease 37%, computer confusion 16%), but nothing to suggest lower-than-average cost consciousness. Outgoings on housing/utilities are high, which may increase salience of energy-saving. No direct quantitative data for this exact item, so the concept-specific correction is applied as the best estimate. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home', which is a high-friction behavior but with a known tendency for under-prediction in previous rounds (actual agreement is higher than baseline). The segment is 'Urban Diversity', with high outgoings on housing/utilities (value=109.83), suggesting cost-consciousness. Quantitative evidence for similar pro-environmental or cost-saving attitudes is low (e.g., only 14.6% agree with 'I make an effort to support local businesses'), but this is not a direct proxy. The concept-specific correction for this item is to INCREASE by 21pp over the baseline, as cost-saving is a strong motivator. Therefore, I use the corrected template: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to the direct concept-specific correction and supporting evidence of high utility outgoings, which likely increases motivation to cut down.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.86
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence ('environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions important when buying a car' at 36%) and correctly notes that the target concept ('fuel consumption is the most important feature') is likely to have even lower agreement due to its stronger framing. The application of the concept-specific correction (-30pp) is appropriate and in line with the system prompt. No qualitative evidence is available to contradict or adjust the estimate, and no demographic upweighting is warranted. The repeated, consistent rationale across runs further supports the robustness of the estimate. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 5.00%
  Slightly agree: 15.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 30.00%
  Strongly disagree: 22.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item, but the closest quantitative evidence is for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions important when buying a car' (36%), which is a related but not identical concept. The target concept ('fuel consumption is the most important feature') is likely to have even lower agreement, as fuel economy is typically less prioritized than environmentalism in car purchase decisions, especially in urban diverse segments. The baseline for this concept per V2 is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. This matches the concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' (reduce by 30pp due to prior over-prediction). No direct evidence suggests higher agreement, and the segment's environmental concern is moderate (36%), so the prediction should not be higher. No qualitative evidence is available to suggest a higher or lower adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxy and clear template guidance.
Run 2: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item, but the closest quantitative evidence is for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions important when buying a car' (36%), which is a related but not identical concept. The actual target ('fuel consumption is the most important feature') is likely to have even lower agreement, as fuel economy is only one of many factors considered when buying a car, and 'most important' is a strong framing. The conservative baseline for this concept (per system prompt) is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. This matches the concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' (reduce by 30pp due to prior over-prediction). No demographic upweighting is justified (urban diversity segment, no strong evidence for higher/lower agreement). Quantitative evidence is prioritized (36% for environmental concern, 13% for insurance, 21% for online research), all suggesting low agreement for high-friction or strongly-framed car purchase attitudes. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchor and explicit system correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but direct quantitative evidence from a highly relevant segment (urban diversity) shows only 36% rate 'environmentally friendly/low CO2' as important when buying a car. This is a closely related but slightly broader concept than fuel consumption, but both are typically underweighted in actual car purchase decisions. The baseline for this concept, per system prompt, is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. This matches the concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' (reduce by 30pp from prior over-prediction). No qualitative evidence suggests higher agreement, and the quantitative evidence is strong and directly relevant. Therefore, the distribution is set exactly to the concept-specific template. Confidence is high due to the strong quantitative match.
Run 4: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', but the V2 prompt specifies a concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' due to historical over-prediction (+30pp). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the 36% agreement for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions important when buying a car' (file=ACORN_urban_diversity.csv, relevance=0.98), which is a closely related but not identical concept. This suggests that environmental/fuel concerns are not a top priority for this segment. No direct evidence supports high agreement. The baseline for this concept is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. No demographic calibration is warranted (urban diversity is not strongly skewed toward environmentalism or fuel economy). No qualitative evidence is available to override the quantitative. Therefore, the concept-specific correction is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude, but the evidence shows low to moderate agreement with environmental/fuel priorities in car buying for this segment (urban diversity). The closest quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 36%, which is higher than the insurance (13%) and energy company (29%) items, but still well below majority agreement. The V2 prompt specifically calls for a -30pp correction for fuel/environmental car priorities, using the template: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. No demographic lift is warranted (urban diversity is not especially green or affluent). No qualitative override is available. The prediction is therefore anchored to the concept-specific correction, with high confidence due to strong quantitative evidence and direct template match.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently references the relevant quantitative proxies: low pro-social engagement (9%), moderate concern about climate change (23%), and relatively high comfort with financial risk (31%). These indicators support the conclusion that this segment is less debt-averse than average, justifying the lower agreement rates. The absence of direct debt aversion data is acknowledged, and the use of a concept-specific correction is appropriate. No qualitative override is available, but the quantitative evidence is strong and well-applied. The prediction is consistent across runs, and the reasoning is transparent and methodologically sound. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. However, the segment (ACORN Urban Diversity) shows low agreement with pro-social and risk-averse attitudes: only 9% help out in the community, 23% see climate change as a major threat, and 31% are comfortable taking financial risks. These suggest a less conservative, more risk-tolerant profile, likely to be less debt-averse than the general population. The concept-specific correction for this item is to use: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (lower than the old baseline, per v2 instructions). No direct quantitative evidence on debt aversion is present, so the concept-specific template is applied without further upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and clear segment profile.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The segment is 'ACORN Urban Diversity'. Quantitative evidence shows low agreement with pro-social and risk-averse attitudes: only 9% help out in the community, 23% see climate change as a major threat, and 31% are comfortable taking financial risks. These suggest a moderate-to-low aversion to debt (since risk tolerance is not extremely low, and pro-social/cautious attitudes are not dominant). The concept-specific correction for 'don't like being in debt' is to use: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. No strong demographic calibration is warranted, as the evidence does not indicate strong budget consciousness or risk aversion. No qualitative override is available. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative proxies and the use of a concept-specific template.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The segment (ACORN Urban Diversity) shows low agreement with pro-social and risk-averse attitudes: only 9% help out in the community, 23% see climate change as the biggest threat, and 31% are comfortable taking risks with money. These figures suggest lower-than-average aversion to debt, as risk-tolerance and low community engagement often correlate with less debt aversion. The concept-specific correction for this item is to use: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (down from the generic attitude template, due to prior over-prediction). No direct quantitative data on debt aversion is present, so the concept-specific correction is applied without further demographic lift or reduction. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and a direct concept-specific correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The most relevant quantitative evidence is from the ACORN urban diversity segment, which shows low agreement with pro-social and risk-averse attitudes: only 9% help out in the community, 23% see climate change as the biggest threat, and 31% are comfortable taking financial risks. These suggest a population that is not especially risk-averse or community-oriented, and may be more tolerant of debt than average. The concept-specific correction for this item is to use: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (down from the original over-predicted 68% agreement). No qualitative evidence is available to override this. The prediction is therefore anchored to the corrected template, with high confidence due to strong quantitative evidence and direct concept-specific adjustment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The most relevant quantitative evidence is from the ACORN urban diversity segment, which shows low agreement with pro-social and risk-averse attitudes: only 9% help out in the community, 23% see climate change as a major threat, and 31% are comfortable taking financial risks. These suggest a segment that is not especially conservative or risk-averse, and may be more tolerant of debt than average. The concept-specific correction for this item is to reduce agreement by 26pp from typical attitude baselines, resulting in: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. This is consistent with the evidence and the conservative adjustment required by the V2 system prompt. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and a clear concept-specific correction.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.73
Critic confidence: 0.92
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently references the conservative baseline for attitude items and adjusts downward based on relevant quantitative proxies: low rates of online savings account management (17%) and lack of direct evidence for high financial self-efficacy. The segment's moderate outgoings on miscellaneous goods and relatively high car ownership are correctly noted as not directly indicative of strong money management confidence. The absence of qualitative evidence is acknowledged, and the rationale for increasing neutrality and disagreement is sound. The repeated, consistent application of these adjustments across runs demonstrates methodological rigor and transparency. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%

  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an attitude item. The conservative baseline for attitudes is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows only 17% manage savings accounts online (suggesting low financial engagement/confidence), and only 9% are very worried about car theft (suggesting low risk aversion or financial anxiety). There is no direct evidence of high financial self-efficacy. The demographic (urban diversity) is likely to have mixed financial skills and confidence, so I slightly lower agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Variance is increased per instructions, and the prediction is pushed lower to avoid over-prediction bias.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: 1) Concept type: This is an 'attitude' item, so the conservative baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. 2) Quantitative evidence: Only 17% manage savings accounts online at home/work, suggesting low financial engagement/confidence. No direct evidence of high financial self-efficacy. 3) Demographic calibration: Urban Diversity segments tend to have more financial complexity and risk, but also more financial stress and lower confidence, so no upward adjustment. 4) No qualitative evidence provided. 5) Variance: Given the low online savings management and moderate car ownership, push 'neither' and 'disagree' slightly higher, and agreement lower. 6) Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative proxy evidence and clear concept type.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an attitude item. For the ACORN Urban Diversity segment, direct quantitative evidence about money management confidence is lacking, but proxy indicators suggest low self-assessed financial competence: only 17% manage savings accounts online (suggesting low financial engagement/comfort), and outgoings on miscellaneous goods are relatively high (31.6%), which may indicate less disciplined budgeting. The baseline for attitude items is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low online savings management and the urban diversity profile (often younger, more transient, and with lower financial stability), I conservatively reduce agreement by 5pp and increase disagreement by 5pp, pushing more into 'neither' and 'slightly disagree'. No direct evidence supports high agreement, and the system bias is to avoid over-prediction. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct quantitative match but supported by relevant proxies.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an attitude item. The conservative attitude baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence from this segment shows only 17% manage savings accounts online (suggesting low financial engagement/confidence), and only 9% are very worried about car theft (suggesting low risk aversion, possibly less financial vigilance). There is no direct evidence of high financial self-efficacy. The segment's outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services are moderate, and car ownership is relatively high (64%), but these do not directly indicate strong money management confidence. No qualitative evidence is available to suggest higher or lower self-assessment. Therefore, I slightly lower agreement from the baseline to reflect the low online financial engagement and lack of strong positive evidence. The prediction is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 32%, D 23%, SD 15%. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct attitudinal data.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an attitude item. The conservative attitude baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows only 17% manage savings accounts online (suggesting low financial engagement/confidence), and only 9% are very worried about car theft (suggesting low risk aversion, possibly less financial vigilance). The segment's outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services are moderate (31.6), not indicating strong frugality or financial discipline. No direct evidence of high financial self-efficacy is present. Therefore, I slightly lower agreement from baseline, increase neutrality and disagreement, and push variance higher to avoid regression to mean. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct self-assessment data but strong proxy evidence.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is well justified. The rationale consistently applies the most relevant quantitative evidence ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', 21% agreement, high relevance) as a proxy for high-friction, practical attitudes in this segment. The repeated use of the concept-specific correction template is appropriate given the documented over-prediction risk (+40pp bias) and the lack of qualitative or demographic evidence to warrant an upward adjustment. The segment's characteristics (urban diversity, mass market, price-sensitive) further support a low agreement estimate. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the reasoning is transparent and consistent across runs. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is a classic over-prediction risk, as shown in the V1 results (+40pp bias). The V2 prompt mandates using the HIGH FRICTION BEHAVIOR template, further reduced for this specific concept. The most relevant quantitative evidence is for 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.21), which is a similarly high-friction, practical attitude and shows only 21% agreement. No direct evidence supports high agreement with comprehensive insurance. Demographic context (urban diversity) does not suggest a strong upward correction for insurance attitudes. Therefore, the concept-specific correction is applied: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear guidance from the prompt.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is subject to a specific corrective template due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp in prior rounds). The most relevant quantitative evidence is for a similar attitude item ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), which is very low (21%), indicating low prioritization of practical/financial caution in this segment. No direct evidence supports high agreement. The segment (urban diversity) is not especially risk-averse or affluent, so no demographic lift is warranted. The concept-specific correction for 'well insured for everything' is applied: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. This matches the evidence hierarchy (quantitative data dominates, no qualitative override). Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and direct template match.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything', which is a high friction behavior/attitude (requires effort, cost, and is often aspirational rather than enacted). The direct quantitative evidence for a similar high-friction attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is very low (0.21), indicating that only about 21% agree. This supports a low agreement prediction. The segment (urban diversity) does not suggest a strong bias toward risk aversion or insurance prioritization. According to the v2 guidelines, this concept is known to be systematically over-predicted (+40pp), so the specific correction template is used: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. No qualitative evidence is present to override this. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and a direct concept-specific correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is subject to a strong concept-specific correction due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp in v1). The correct template is the HIGH FRICTION BEHAVIOR correction: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The direct quantitative evidence for a similar attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is very low (21%), confirming that this segment (Urban Diversity) is unlikely to strongly prioritize practical, risk-averse, or cost-protective behaviors. No qualitative evidence is available to contradict this. Demographic calibration is not applied because the direct quantitative evidence is highly relevant and overrides. The prediction is therefore anchored to the concept-specific correction, with high confidence due to the strong evidence match and the system's guardrails for this item.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything.' This is a high-friction behavior/attitude (comprehensive insurance is costly and rarely prioritized). The most relevant quantitative evidence is for a similarly effortful, practical attitude: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (21% agreement), which is low and highly relevant (relevance=0.98). Other evidence (ad receptivity, mass market shopping) suggests mainstream, price-sensitive, and not especially risk-averse attitudes. The V2 system prompt mandates a strong downward correction for this concept due to historic +40pp over-prediction. The high-friction template (SA 5%, A 18%, N 27%, D 28%, SD 22%) is further reduced per the concept-specific correction (SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%). No demographic lift is warranted for this urban, mass-market, price-sensitive segment. Confidence is high due to direct, highly relevant quantitative evidence and strong system guidance for this concept.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.86
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes is sufficiently justified based on the evidence provided. The topline quantitative data clearly show very low rates of vegan (2%) and vegetarian (4%) diets, with a majority (59%) eating meat and a substantial minority (33%) pescatarian/flexitarian/other. The rationale for lowering agreement from the attitude baseline is well-supported by this evidence, as it indicates that strong commitment to restrictive healthy eating is rare in this population. The lack of strong qualitative evidence to counterbalance the quantitative findings is also appropriately noted. The adjustment of the attitude baseline to reflect more neutrality and disagreement is methodologically sound given the data. Confidence is high due to the strong relevance and clarity of the quantitative evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 31.20%
  Slightly disagree: 22.80%
  Strongly disagree: 16.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: 1) Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. 2) Quantitative evidence shows very low vegan (2%) and vegetarian (4%) rates, with 59% eating meat and 33% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive healthy diets. 3) No strong qualitative evidence to increase agreement. 4) Therefore, I slightly lower agreement from baseline to reflect the low prevalence of restrictive healthy eating, and increase disagreement. 5) Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The quantitative evidence shows extremely low rates of vegan (2%) and vegetarian (4%) diets, with a majority (59%) eating meat and a significant minority (33%) in pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may be open to healthy eating, strong commitment is rare. The item is an 'attitude' type, so the baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, the direct evidence of low vegan/vegetarian prevalence and high meat consumption indicates that strong agreement with 'Healthy Eating' is likely lower than the baseline. Therefore, I reduce SA/A by 5pp each and increase N/D/SD accordingly, resulting in a more skeptical distribution. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: 1) Concept type: 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude item, so the attitude baseline applies (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%). 2) Quantitative evidence: Only 2% vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 33% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 59% eating meat. This suggests that while some may value healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive healthy diets. This pushes agreement lower than baseline. 3) No strong qualitative evidence to suggest higher agreement. 4) Demographic calibration not applied due to lack of specific segment cues. 5) Increased variance: Given the low vegan/vegetarian rates, disagreement is pushed higher. Final distribution is slightly below baseline for agreement, with higher neutrality and disagreement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: 1) Concept type is 'attitude', so the baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. 2) Quantitative evidence shows very low vegan (2%) and vegetarian (4%) rates, with 59% eating meat and 33% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly health-driven. 3) No qualitative evidence provided to suggest higher agreement. 4) No demographic calibration needed as this is a general urban diversity segment. 5) Given the low prevalence of strict healthy eating behaviors, agreement is predicted slightly below the attitude baseline, with more disagreement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude type). Direct quantitative evidence shows only 2% vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 33% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 59% eating meat. This suggests that while a minority actively pursue restrictive healthy diets, a significant portion may have some awareness or moderate attitudes toward healthy eating, but not strong commitment. The attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%) is adjusted downward due to the low prevalence of strict healthy eating behaviors, indicating that strong agreement is likely below baseline. The distribution is shifted toward neutrality and disagreement, reflecting the evidence that most do not follow strict healthy diets. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run demonstrates careful consideration of the available quantitative evidence, particularly the low rate (9%) of 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' as a proxy for proactive retirement planning. The distinction between attitude (belief in responsibility) and behavior (actual planning) is clearly articulated, and the use of a baseline for attitude items is methodologically sound. Adjustments to agreement and neutrality/disagreement are modest and well-supported by the evidence. The absence of strong qualitative or demographic evidence is correctly noted, and confidence is appropriately high given the strong quantitative anchors. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 11.40%
  Slightly agree: 26.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 29.00%
  Slightly disagree: 19.40%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=11.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about personal responsibility for retirement security. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (9%), which is very low, suggesting little proactive behavior, but this is about action, not belief. Other attitude items in this segment ('I only save for a specific purpose' at 41%, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 32%) indicate moderate agreement with self-reliance and effortful financial behaviors, but not high. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low action rate but moderate attitude agreement, I slightly increase agreement (+2pp) to reflect that people may endorse responsibility in principle more than in practice, but not by much. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence to shift further. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors.
Run 2: Strongly agree=11.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=29.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is an attitude item. There is no direct quantitative evidence for this exact statement, but the closest proxy is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (9%), which is very low and suggests little proactive behavior. Other financial attitudes in this segment (e.g., 'I only save for a specific purpose' at 41%, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 32%) indicate moderate to low agreement with proactive or self-driven financial behaviors. The baseline for attitude items is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low evidence for proactive retirement planning, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is moderate-high due to the presence of relevant proxies, but not a direct match.
Run 3: Strongly agree=11.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is an attitude item. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (9%), which is very low and suggests little proactive planning, and 'I only save for a specific purpose' (41%), which shows moderate goal-oriented saving. The other items ('trust price comparison sites', 'switching utilities worth effort') are less directly relevant but indicate moderate engagement with financial self-management (32-53%). The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low proactive retirement planning (9%), I slightly reduce agreement from baseline, but not drastically, since the concept is about responsibility (belief), not action. No strong qualitative evidence to override. Final: SA 11%, A 26%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about personal responsibility for retirement security. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the very low agreement (9%) with 'Plans to use other investments for retirement', suggesting low proactive engagement with retirement planning in this segment. Other financial attitudes (e.g., saving for a specific purpose at 41%, trust in price comparison sites at 53%) show moderate agreement, but none directly address responsibility for retirement. The baseline for attitude items is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low engagement with retirement-specific planning, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No qualitative evidence contradicts this. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence, but not a direct match.
Run 5: Strongly agree=11.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: 1. Concept type: This is an 'attitude' item, so the attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%) is the starting point. 2. Quantitative evidence: The closest direct evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (9% agree), which is much lower than the baseline, suggesting that few in this segment actively plan for self-driven retirement security. However, this is a behavioral intention, not an attitude, so it should not fully override the attitude baseline, but it does indicate lower agreement. 3. Other financial attitudes (e.g., 'I only save for a specific purpose' at 41%, 'Switching utilities worth the effort' at 32%) suggest moderate to low proactive financial engagement. 4. Demographic calibration: Urban diversity segments tend to be younger and less financially secure, so no upward adjustment is warranted. 5. Variance: Given the low behavioral evidence, agreement should be nudged slightly lower than the attitude baseline. 6. Final adjustment: Lower SA/A by 2pp each, increase N/D/SD slightly to reflect the evidence. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the high friction baseline and the concept-specific correction (reduction by 15pp due to systematic over-prediction), and this is well-supported by the available quantitative evidence (high outgoings, low engagement in effortful activities) and the absence of direct evidence for higher switching motivation. The qualitative context is neutral, and no demographic calibration is warranted. The confidence is appropriately rated as moderately high, given the indirect nature of the evidence. No corrective feedback is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort', which is classified as a high friction behavior. The baseline for high friction behavior is: SA 5%, A 18%, N 27%, D 28%, SD 22%. However, the concept-specific correction for this item is to REDUCE by 15pp due to systematic over-prediction and evidence that inertia is strong. Quantitative evidence from the segment shows high outgoings on utilities, but no direct evidence of switching behavior or high motivation to switch. The qualitative context is neutral and does not suggest strong agreement. Therefore, I use the concept-specific template: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. No demographic calibration is applied as there is no strong evidence for it in this segment. Confidence is moderately high due to the presence of relevant quantitative data and a strong concept-specific correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort', which is classified as a high friction behavior. The segment is 'Urban Diversity' (from ACORN), with no evidence of unusually high or low switching behavior in the quantitative data. The closest quantitative proxies are low attendance at sporting events (16%) and places of worship (18%), suggesting low engagement in optional, effortful activities. Outgoings on utilities are high, but this does not directly indicate willingness to switch. The concept-specific correction for this item is to reduce agreement by 15pp from the high friction baseline, due to systematic over-prediction. Therefore, the template applied is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. No demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong concept-specific correction and relevant proxies for effortful behaviors.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort', which is classified as a high friction behavior (requires effort, often low follow-through). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the high outgoings on council tax, utilities, etc. (value=2859.38), which suggests a significant financial burden, but this does not directly indicate willingness to switch. There is no direct quantitative evidence of switching behavior or attitudes toward switching. The closest proxy is the general outgoings, which may slightly increase agreement, but not substantially. The baseline for high friction behavior is: SA 5%, A 18%, N 27%, D 28%, SD 22%. The concept-specific correction for this item is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (as per system prompt, due to over-prediction in v1). No strong demographic calibration is warranted here. The evidence is mostly indirect, so confidence is moderate-high, but not maximal.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as a high friction behavior. The direct quantitative evidence does not indicate high engagement with switching or cost-saving behaviors (e.g., only 16% visit sporting events, 18% visit places of worship—both low engagement activities), and there is no evidence of strong cost-consciousness or proactive switching in the segment. The segment's outgoings on utilities are substantial, but this does not directly imply willingness to switch. According to the V2 template for high friction behaviors, the baseline is SA 5%, A 18%, N 27%, D 28%, SD 22%. However, the concept-specific correction for this item is to REDUCE by 15pp due to systematic over-prediction in prior rounds. Therefore, the adjusted distribution is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. No demographic calibration is warranted as there is no evidence of extreme cost sensitivity or inertia beyond the baseline. Confidence is moderately high due to the strong alignment with both the concept-specific correction and the lack of evidence for higher agreement.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort', which is classified as a high friction behavior. The baseline for high friction behavior is: SA 5%, A 18%, N 27%, D 28%, SD 22%. The segment is 'Urban Diversity', with no direct evidence of high switching motivation or strong cost sensitivity in the quantitative data. Outgoings on utilities are moderate, but there is no indication of above-average engagement with switching or cost-saving behaviors. No qualitative evidence suggests a strong pro-switching attitude. Therefore, I use the concept-specific correction for this item (which is to reduce by 15pp from prior over-prediction), resulting in: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. This matches the template for this concept. Confidence is moderately high due to strong alignment with evidence and the absence of contradictory data.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references relevant quantitative proxies (online purchase rates by category) from the ACORN Urban Diversity segment, which indicate a mixed but moderate digital adoption profile. The application of a concept-specific correction to the attitude baseline is methodologically sound, especially given the lack of direct qualitative evidence to override the quantitative findings. The repeated use of the same adjusted template across runs, with clear explanation of the correction (reducing agreement by 12pp due to higher digital adoption), demonstrates consistency and appropriate calibration. Confidence is high due to the strong alignment between the evidence and the adjustment applied. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 23.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases' (attitude). Direct quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for Alcoholic drinks (23%) and Pet care (24%), but higher for Home appliances (52%) and Holiday/travel (54%). This suggests a mixed but overall moderate adoption of online/digital payments in this segment, with a notable minority still using cash, especially for everyday or lower-value items. The concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is applied (SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%), as per the V2 template, which is already calibrated for over-prediction. No strong qualitative evidence is present to override this. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and a direct template match.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases' (attitude). Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for Alcoholic drinks (23%) and Pet care (24%), but higher for Home appliances (52%) and Holiday/travel (54%). This suggests a mixed digital adoption profile in the 'urban diversity' segment. The concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to reduce by 12pp from the attitude baseline, due to higher digital adoption than attitudes suggest. Therefore, I used the adjusted template: SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. No strong qualitative evidence was available to override this. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and a direct concept-specific correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases' (attitude). Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for Alcoholic drinks (23%) and Pet care (24%), but higher for Home appliances (52%) and Holiday/travel (54%). This suggests a mixed but overall moderate digital adoption in this segment. The concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to reduce agreement by 12pp from the attitude baseline, reflecting higher digital adoption than attitudes suggest. Therefore, the distribution is: SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and a clear concept-specific correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases' (attitude). Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday categories in this segment (alcoholic drinks 23%, pet care 24%), but higher for home appliances (52%) and holiday/travel (54%). This suggests a moderate but not strong preference for digital over cash, with a significant portion still using cash for routine purchases. The concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is applied: SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. No direct quantitative evidence on cash preference, but the low online rates for daily goods support a moderate cash preference. No qualitative evidence was available. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and a concept-specific template.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases' for the ACORN Urban Diversity segment. This is an attitude item, so the attitude baseline is: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, the concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to reduce by 12pp due to over-prediction in previous rounds, so the template is: SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for alcohol (23%) and pet care (24%), but higher for home appliances (52%) and holidays (54%). This suggests a mixed digital adoption profile, but not a strongly cash-oriented one. No direct evidence on cash preference, so the concept-specific correction is most appropriate. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and a direct concept-specific correction.
