### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 2
Estimator average confidence: 0.71
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationales for all runs consistently note that the available quantitative evidence (current account management by phone, country of birth) and qualitative evidence (segment description) do not directly inform the specific attitude concept in question. The use of the 'Generic Attitude' baseline from the V6 semantic category framework is appropriate in the absence of more targeted evidence. The decision not to apply demographic calibration is well-justified, as there is no strong evidence to support such an adjustment. The rationales clearly delineate the limits of inference and avoid over-interpreting weak signals. No corrective feedback is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.75 / Rationale: The target is an 'attitude' concept, but no direct evidence about the specific attitude is provided. The quantitative evidence relates to current account management by phone and country of birth, which are not relevant to the likely semantic category of the concept. The qualitative evidence describes the segment as successful, younger, urban singles/couples in expensive flats, but does not directly inform the attitude in question. Therefore, the most robust approach is to use the baseline for 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' (30% agreement: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%), as this is the default for generic attitudes not tied to cost-saving, self-reliance, or effortful behaviors. No demographic calibration is justified given the lack of directly relevant evidence. This approach avoids over-interpreting weak signals and clearly delineates the limits of inference from the evidence provided.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.70 / Rationale: The target is an 'attitude' concept, but the provided quantitative evidence (current account management by phone, country of birth) is not directly relevant to the attitude in question. The qualitative evidence describes the segment as successful younger singles/couples in expensive London flats, but does not directly inform the specific attitude. According to the V6 semantic category framework, in the absence of strong direct evidence, the default for a generic attitude is 35% agreement (Environmental Virtue Signaling baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). No demographic calibration is justified, as the evidence does not directly support any adjustment. Therefore, the baseline is used without modification, and the rationale explicitly notes the limits of inference from the evidence provided.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The target is an 'attitude' concept, but no specific attitude statement is provided. In the absence of a concrete attitude, I default to the 'Generic Attitude' semantic category (baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence (current account management by phone, country of birth) is not directly relevant to attitudes, and the qualitative evidence only describes the segment as young, urban, and affluent, without indicating a specific attitude direction. Following the critic feedback, I do not apply any demographic calibration, as there is no strong evidence to justify it. The estimate strictly follows the generic attitude baseline, with no adjustments, and the rationale explicitly states the limits of inference from the evidence provided.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.70 / Rationale: The target is an 'attitude' concept, but no direct evidence about the specific attitude is provided. The quantitative evidence relates to current account management by phone and country of birth, which are not relevant to the attitude in question. The qualitative evidence describes the segment as young, successful, urban, and affluent, but does not directly inform the attitude. According to the V6 semantic category framework, in the absence of direct evidence, the default for generic attitudes is 35% agreement (Environmental Virtue Signaling baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). No demographic calibration is justified due to lack of directly relevant evidence. Confidence is moderate because the estimate relies solely on the baseline category without strong supporting or contradicting evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.70 / Rationale: The target is an 'attitude' item with no further concept-specific context provided. The quantitative evidence (current account management by phone, country of birth) is not directly relevant to the attitude concept, and the qualitative segment description (young, affluent, urban) does not specify an attitude direction. According to the V6 semantic category framework, when there is no clear fit to cost-consciousness, self-reliance, debt aversion, environmental, expensive purchase, health, effort, or payment preference, the default is 'Generic Attitude' (baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). No demographic calibration is justified due to lack of directly relevant evidence. Confidence is moderate because the evidence is weak and the estimate relies on the generic baseline.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.87
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently and correctly grounds the predicted distribution in the quantitative evidence: only 16% self-identify as environmentalists and 27% express skepticism toward energy companies' environmental care, both supporting low agreement with the target attitude. The qualitative note about aspirational buying is acknowledged but appropriately weighted as secondary to the quantitative toplines. The semantic category ('Environmental Virtue Signaling') and its baseline are transparently applied, and the lack of demographic calibration is reasonable given the evidence. The repeated rationales are clear, consistent, and methodologically sound. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). Quantitative evidence shows low self-identification as environmentalist (16%) and moderate skepticism toward energy companies (27%), both supporting low agreement. The qualitative note ('try to buy only from companies who are socially and environmentally responsible') suggests some aspiration, but the quantitative evidence dominates. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline, with high confidence due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). Quantitative evidence shows only 16% consider themselves environmentalists and 27% think energy companies don't care about the environment, both supporting low agreement. The qualitative note ('try to buy only from companies who are socially and environmentally responsible') suggests some aspirational support, but this is outweighed by the low quantitative agreement. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Therefore, the baseline is maintained, with a distribution reflecting the typical attitudinal split for environmental virtue signaling. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between category and evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). Quantitative evidence shows only 16% consider themselves environmentalists and 27% think energy companies don't care about the environment, both supporting low agreement. The qualitative note ('try to buy only from companies who are socially and environmentally responsible') suggests some aspiration, but the quantitative evidence dominates. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline, with confidence high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). Quantitative evidence supports this: only 16% consider themselves environmentalists and 27% think energy companies don't care about the environment, both indicating low agreement with environmental identity/attitudes in this segment. The qualitative note ('try to buy only from companies who are socially and environmentally responsible') suggests some aspiration, but the quantitative evidence dominates. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. Therefore, the baseline is maintained, with the distribution reflecting low agreement and a high proportion of neutrality or disagreement. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between category and evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). Quantitative evidence shows only 16% consider themselves environmentalists and 27% are skeptical of energy companies' environmental care, both supporting low agreement. The qualitative note ('try to buy only from companies who are socially and environmentally responsible') suggests some aspiration, but does not override the quantitative baseline. No strong demographic calibration applies. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline, with confidence high due to strong quantitative alignment.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.86
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for agreement with 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the relevant semantic category ('Cost-Consciousness Behaviors') and aligns the high baseline agreement with both the qualitative evidence (cost is a more important factor) and the quantitative evidence (high outgoings on utilities). There is no contradictory evidence, and the attitudinal and demographic data do not suggest a need for adjustment. The estimate is well-grounded in the provided evidence and the reasoning is transparent and appropriate.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.00%
  Slightly agree: 40.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 15.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: This concept falls under the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving money on utilities is a universal motivator. The qualitative note ('Make an effort to recycle but cost is a more important factor') reinforces that cost-saving is a priority for this segment. The quantitative evidence does not directly contradict this, and the high outgoings on utilities suggest awareness of energy costs. No strong demographic or attitudinal evidence to adjust the baseline. Therefore, the estimate remains close to the category baseline: 70% agreement (30% strongly agree, 40% slightly agree), with moderate neutrality and low disagreement.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: This concept falls under the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which typically sees high agreement (~70%) because saving money on utilities is a universal concern. The qualitative note ('cost is a more important factor') reinforces that this segment is highly motivated by cost-saving actions, supporting the high baseline. Quantitative evidence does not directly contradict this: the segment's high outgoings on utilities (value=125.21) suggest awareness and incentive to reduce costs. No evidence suggests unusually low agreement. Therefore, the baseline distribution is appropriate, with high agreement (70% combined SA/A), moderate neutrality (15%), and low disagreement (15%). Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supportive qualitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: This concept falls under the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving money on utilities is a universal motivator. The qualitative note ('cost is a more important factor') reinforces that cost-saving behaviors are prioritized in this segment. No quantitative evidence directly contradicts this, and the segment's high outgoings on utilities suggest awareness of energy costs. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated here, so the baseline is maintained. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and qualitative support.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: This concept falls into the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving money on utilities is a universal motivator. The qualitative note ('Make an effort to recycle but cost is a more important factor') reinforces that cost-saving actions are prioritized in this segment. The quantitative evidence does not directly contradict this: high outgoings on utilities suggest awareness of costs, and the relatively low agreement with supporting local businesses (0.15) does not undermine the likelihood of cost-saving behaviors. No strong demographic or attitudinal evidence suggests deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline: 30% strongly agree, 40% slightly agree, 15% neutral, 10% slightly disagree, 5% strongly disagree.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: This concept fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving money on utilities is a universal concern. The qualitative note ('Make an effort to recycle but cost is a more important factor') reinforces that cost-saving behaviors are prioritized in this segment. Quantitative evidence does not directly contradict this pattern. No demographic calibration is needed as this is a universal cost-saving behavior. The estimate is thus anchored at the category baseline: 30% strongly agree, 40% slightly agree, 15% neither, 10% slightly disagree, 5% strongly disagree.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale demonstrates a clear understanding of the distinction between 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' (quantitative topline, 0.56) and 'fuel consumption as the most important feature,' noting that the former is broader and potentially inflated by social desirability. The qualitative evidence ('cost is a more important factor') is appropriately used to nudge agreement upward from the baseline for expensive purchases, but not to majority levels, reflecting the high bar set by 'most important.' The distribution of responses is consistent with the evidence and the semantic category, and the confidence is appropriately high given the strength and relevance of the evidence. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.80%
  Slightly agree: 21.60%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.20%
  Strongly disagree: 16.40%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments (~15-20% agreement). The statement 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' is about prioritizing a specific (cost-related) feature in a high-cost purchase context. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (0.56), but this is a broader, more aspirational environmental value, not strictly cost-saving. Qualitative evidence ('cost is a more important factor') suggests cost is prioritized over environmental concerns, but 'most important' is a high bar—many buyers also value reliability, brand, safety, etc. Thus, agreement is higher than for generic environmental attitudes, but still low due to the high threshold ('most important'). Baseline for Expensive Purchases is 15% agreement; evidence of cost-consciousness nudges this up slightly, but not to majority. Distribution reflects a large neutral/disagree segment, with only a minority strongly agreeing. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which typically has low agreement (~15-20%) because it requires prioritizing a specific, practical feature over others in a high-cost context. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the high agreement (0.56) for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' as an important car feature, but this is a broader, more aspirational environmental value, not strictly about fuel economy. Qualitative notes indicate that cost is important but not always the overriding factor. The baseline for this category is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%. Given the relatively high value for environmental concern in car buying, I adjust upward, but not to the same level, since fuel consumption is a narrower, more utilitarian concern than environmental friendliness. Thus, I estimate agreement (SA+A) at 32%, with the rest distributed across neutral and disagreement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence, but the category baseline keeps the estimate conservative.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which typically has low agreement (~15-20%) because it requires prioritizing a specific feature (fuel economy) over others in a high-cost decision. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the high agreement (0.56) for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' being important when buying a car, but this is not the same as fuel consumption and is likely inflated by virtue signaling. Qualitative evidence indicates that cost is important, but not necessarily the most important factor. The baseline for this category is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%. Given the evidence that environmental/fuel factors are somewhat salient (0.56), I have increased agreement modestly (SA 8%, A 22%), but kept the majority in neutral/disagree, as most buyers consider multiple factors (price, brand, style, etc.) and do not single out fuel consumption as the top priority. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear semantic fit.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=20.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=26.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, as it relates to a high-cost decision (car purchase) and prioritization of a specific feature. The closest direct quantitative evidence is the 0.56 agreement for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' as an important car feature, but this is not the same as fuel consumption (environmental concern is typically lower than cost concern, but the two are related). Qualitative evidence indicates that cost is a more important factor than environmental virtue, suggesting fuel consumption (a cost-saving feature) may be prioritized by some, but not universally. The baseline for this category is low (SA 3%, A 12%), but the evidence for environmental features being important is much higher (56%), though this is likely inflated by social desirability and does not directly translate to fuel consumption being the single most important feature. Therefore, I raise the agreement above the baseline but keep it well below the environmental feature topline, reflecting that while many consider fuel consumption important, few consider it the most important. The distribution reflects a minority in strong agreement, a moderate group in slight agreement, and a large portion either neutral or disagreeing, consistent with the expensive purchase/feature prioritization pattern. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear semantic category fit.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which typically has low agreement (~15-20%) because it requires prioritizing a specific (cost-related) feature over others in a high-cost context. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the high agreement (0.56) for 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions', which is related but not identical—environmental concern is not the same as cost/fuel efficiency, though there is overlap. Qualitative evidence ('cost is a more important factor') suggests that cost (and thus fuel consumption) is indeed salient, but not universally dominant. The baseline for this category is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%. Given the strong (but not overwhelming) evidence for environmental/fuel-related features being important (0.56), I adjust the agreement upward, but not to majority levels, as 'most important' is a high bar and other features (e.g., safety, reliability, price) also compete. Final estimate: SA 8%, A 22%, N 28%, D 25%, SD 17%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchor and clear category fit.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.78
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative item ('I do not mind taking risks with my money', value=0.44), which is a reasonable inverse proxy for debt aversion. The demographic note ('family with children; degree') is appropriately used to justify a minor upward calibration in agreement, but not to an excessive degree. Other quantitative items are correctly identified as less relevant. The repeated use of the baseline and the minor demographic adjustment is methodologically sound, and the confidence level is appropriately described as moderate-high. No major evidence gaps or logical leaps are present. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 12.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~43% (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: the closest related item is 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (value=0.44), which suggests a moderate level of risk tolerance in this segment, but not a majority. The other evidence (helping out in the community, climate change concern, likelihood to move) is less directly relevant and all have lower agreement values (0.14–0.31), indicating this segment is not strongly consensus-driven on attitudinal items. Demographically, the segment is 'family with children; degree', which may slightly increase risk aversion (families tend to be more debt-averse), but the effect is small (+2pp at most). Therefore, the baseline is maintained with only minor calibration, resulting in a moderate agreement distribution and moderate confidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: the closest related item is 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (value=0.44), suggesting a moderate split in risk attitudes. The segment is described as 'Family with children; Degree', which may slightly increase risk aversion (families with children tend to be more debt-averse), but the effect is small (+2pp at most). Other evidence (community involvement, climate concern, likelihood to move) is less directly relevant. Therefore, the baseline distribution is appropriate, with a slight tilt toward agreement due to the family demographic. Confidence is moderate-high due to the clear semantic fit and supporting evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: the closest related item is 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (value=0.44), which suggests moderate risk aversion in this segment. The other evidence (community involvement, climate change concern, likelihood to move) is less directly relevant. Demographically, the segment is more likely to be families with children and degree holders, which may slightly increase risk aversion (families often more debt-averse), but the effect is small (+2pp at most). Therefore, the baseline is maintained, with a moderate confidence due to the supporting but not directly matching evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~43% (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the closest quantitative evidence: 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (value=0.44), which is a related but inverse attitude (risk-tolerant, so likely lower debt aversion in this segment). The other evidence (community involvement, climate change concern, likelihood to move) is less directly relevant. Demographically, the segment is 'family with children' and 'degree', which may slightly increase risk tolerance (and thus slightly lower debt aversion), but the effect is small. No strong evidence to deviate from the category baseline. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the Debt/Risk Aversion pattern, with moderate agreement and a substantial neutral/disagree proportion. Confidence is moderate-high due to category fit and supporting evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~43%. The closest quantitative evidence is 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (44% agreement), which is a related but inverse attitude—suggesting that risk aversion (and thus debt aversion) is not dominant in this segment. The segment is described as 'Family with children; Degree', which may slightly increase risk aversion due to family responsibilities, but the effect is modest. Other evidence (community involvement, climate concern, mobility) is not directly relevant. Therefore, I use the category baseline with minor upward calibration for family status, resulting in an estimated 43% agreement (18% strongly agree, 25% slightly agree), with the remainder distributed per the category pattern. Confidence is moderate-high due to the clear semantic fit and supporting evidence.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationales consistently reference the semantic category ('Self-Reliance Identity'), which is appropriate for the statement 'I am very good at managing money.' The baseline agreement rates are well-established for this type of self-assessment, and the available quantitative evidence (moderate online savings management, high private car ownership, high outgoings) supports the assumption of financial engagement and capability without contradicting the baseline. The qualitative note about London location is acknowledged but not over-weighted. There is no evidence suggesting a need to deviate from the category norm. The justification is clear, methodologically sound, and confidence is appropriately high.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 8.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement due to positive self-concept and social desirability. The segment is predominantly in London (urban, affluent), which may slightly increase self-confidence in financial management but not dramatically. Quantitative evidence (e.g., 35% manage savings online, 69% privately own cars) suggests moderate financial engagement and capability, supporting the baseline. No evidence suggests a major deviation from the category norm. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the Self-Reliance Identity baseline: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') is a classic 'Self-Reliance Identity' statement. This category typically sees high agreement due to social desirability and positive self-concept, with a baseline of 60% agreement (SA 25%, A 35%). The quantitative evidence is not directly about self-assessed money management skill, but does show moderate online savings management (35%) and high private car ownership (69%), suggesting financial capability and confidence. The segment is predominantly in London (urban, affluent), which may slightly boost self-confidence but not enough to warrant a major calibration. No evidence contradicts the baseline, so the category baseline is used. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of conflicting evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement due to positive self-concept and social desirability bias. The segment is predominantly in London (urban, affluent), which may slightly increase self-confidence in financial management but not dramatically. Quantitative evidence is not directly about self-assessed money management skill, but the high outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services and high private car ownership suggest affluence and financial activity, not necessarily skill. The online savings management rate (35%) is moderate, indicating digital engagement but not universal. No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the category baseline. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the Self-Reliance Identity baseline: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') is a classic 'Self-Reliance Identity' statement. This category typically sees high agreement (baseline: 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 20% neither, 12% slightly disagree, 8% strongly disagree; ~60% agreement) due to social desirability and positive self-concept. The segment is 'Flourishing Capital', predominantly in London, likely higher income and education, which may slightly increase confidence in financial self-management, but the baseline already captures this effect. Quantitative evidence (e.g., 35% manage savings online, 69% privately owned car) suggests financial engagement but does not directly measure self-assessed competence, so the baseline holds. No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the category norm. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Self-Reliance Identity. The statement 'I am very good at managing money' is a positive self-assessment of competence and responsibility, which typically receives high agreement due to social desirability bias and positive self-concept. The baseline for this category is SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8% (60% agreement). Quantitative evidence is limited but not contradictory: 35% manage savings online (suggests moderate financial engagement), and the segment is predominantly urban (London), which does not strongly shift the baseline. No evidence suggests lower or higher financial self-confidence. Therefore, the baseline is applied with high confidence.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently anchors the prediction in both the semantic category ('Expensive Purchases/Commitments') and the most relevant quantitative evidence ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', value=0.14, relevance=0.78). The qualitative note ('cost is a more important factor') is appropriately used to reinforce the cost-sensitivity of the segment, supporting the low agreement estimate. The topline distribution is well-calibrated to the available evidence, and the confidence in the estimate is warranted given the strong alignment between the evidence and the prediction. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 4.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 23.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' fits the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) due to the cost barrier and the fact that comprehensive insurance is not a universal priority. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.14), which is a similar high-cost, risk-mitigation attitude and shows very low agreement. Qualitative evidence ('cost is a more important factor') further suggests that this segment is cost-sensitive and unlikely to prioritize comprehensive insurance. No evidence suggests a higher agreement than the baseline. Therefore, the estimate is close to the category baseline: Strongly agree 4%, Slightly agree 13%, Neither 28%, Slightly disagree 32%, Strongly disagree 23%. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between category, evidence, and qualitative context.
Run 2: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=24.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') fits the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) due to the high cost and non-universality of comprehensive insurance. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.14, relevance=0.78), which is also a high-cost, risk-averse attitude and shows low agreement (14%). The qualitative note ('cost is a more important factor') further suggests that this segment prioritizes cost over comprehensive coverage. No evidence suggests higher agreement. Therefore, the baseline (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%) is maintained, with slight calibration to match the 14% agreement in the closest quantitative anchor. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between category, evidence, and qualitative context.
Run 3: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'It is important to be well insured for everything' requires a willingness to pay for comprehensive insurance, which is a high-cost, non-universal financial commitment. The baseline for this category is low agreement (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). Quantitative evidence supports this: only 14% agree that 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (another expensive, risk-mitigating feature), suggesting low prioritization of costly protective measures. Qualitative evidence ('cost is a more important factor') further reinforces that this segment is cost-sensitive and unlikely to prioritize comprehensive insurance. No strong demographic calibration applies. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between category, evidence, and context.
Run 4: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') fits the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) due to the high cost and non-universality of comprehensive insurance. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.14), which is similarly a high-cost, risk-averse attitude and shows low agreement. The qualitative note ('cost is a more important factor') further suggests that this segment prioritizes cost over comprehensive coverage. No evidence suggests higher agreement. Therefore, the estimate is anchored at the category baseline (SA 3%, A 12%), with the remainder distributed to neutral and disagreement, matching the pattern of low agreement and high cost-sensitivity. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between category, evidence, and qualitative context.
Run 5: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) because insurance is a costly, non-universal priority. The closest quantitative anchor is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.14), which is also a high-cost, risk-averse attitude and supports a low agreement estimate. The qualitative note ('cost is a more important factor') further suggests that this segment prioritizes cost over comprehensive insurance. No evidence suggests higher agreement. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline, with a slight nudge toward disagreement due to cost sensitivity in this segment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between category, quantitative, and qualitative evidence.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes is sufficiently justified based on the evidence provided. The quantitative data on eating habits (very low vegan/vegetarian rates, majority meat-eating, and a significant pescatarian/flexitarian/other segment) directly supports the conclusion that strong behavioral commitment to healthy eating is rare, but moderate agreement with the concept exists. The qualitative notes do not contradict this, and the rationale for maintaining the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' baseline is clearly articulated and consistent across runs. The confidence is high due to the direct relevance and strength of the quantitative evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 26.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan and 5% vegetarian, with 59% eating meat and 33% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while there may be some aspiration or mild agreement with healthy eating, actual strong commitment is low. The semantic category is 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' (baseline: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%). The evidence supports this baseline: the low vegan/vegetarian rates indicate that strong agreement is rare, but the presence of pescatarian/flexitarian/other (33%) suggests a moderate segment is at least somewhat health-conscious. Qualitative notes (e.g., 'eating out') do not indicate a strong health focus. Therefore, the baseline is maintained, with high confidence due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, which by default would fall under the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category (baseline: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%). The quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan and 5% vegetarian, with 33% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, and 59% eat meat. This suggests that while there is some openness to alternative diets, the majority are not strongly health-restrictive in their eating habits. This supports the baseline: there is moderate agreement with healthy eating attitudes, but not strong behavioral commitment. No demographic calibration is needed as the evidence is highly relevant and overrides generic baselines. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence provided is about actual eating behaviors (vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, meat-eating rates). The low prevalence of vegan (1%) and vegetarian (5%) diets, with a majority (59%) eating meat and 33% in the pescatarian/flexitarian/other category, suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual adoption of strict healthy eating behaviors is low. This aligns with the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category, which typically sees moderate agreement (~38%) due to the attitude-behavior gap. The qualitative notes (e.g., 'eating out') do not indicate a strong health focus. Therefore, the baseline for health-conscious attitudes (SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%) is appropriate, with high confidence due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan and 5% vegetarian, with 59% eating meat and 33% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while there may be some aspiration or positive attitude toward healthy eating, actual dietary behaviors are not strongly aligned with strict health-focused diets. The semantic category is 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' (baseline: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%). No strong demographic or qualitative evidence suggests deviation from this baseline. The agreement is moderate, reflecting aspirational but not universal endorsement of healthy eating attitudes in this segment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan and 5% vegetarian, with 59% eating meat and 33% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while there may be some aspiration toward healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with strict health-focused diets. The baseline for 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' is 38% agreement (12% SA, 26% A), which fits the evidence: moderate agreement, but not universal. The qualitative notes (eating out, gardening, cycling) suggest some health and lifestyle interest, but not a dominant health-conscious identity. Therefore, the baseline is maintained, with a slight tilt toward neutrality and disagreement due to the high prevalence of meat-eating and low vegan/vegetarian rates. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.92
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the semantic category ('Self-Reliance Identity') and its established baseline, which is appropriate for the target concept. The demographic calibration (older, semi-rural, likely more traditional and self-reliant) is well-argued and supported by the qualitative profile. The quantitative evidence is correctly identified as only weakly related (since it measures behavior, not identity), and the lack of direct contradiction is noted. The slight upward adjustment to the baseline is reasonable given the segment's characteristics. The confidence is high due to the strong semantic fit, demographic alignment, and absence of contradictory evidence. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 27.80%
  Slightly agree: 34.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.00%
  Slightly disagree: 11.80%
  Strongly disagree: 7.60%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~60% agreement (SA 25%, A 35%). This is a positive self-concept statement about personal responsibility, which is typically inflated by social desirability bias. The segment is older, semi-rural, and likely more traditional, which supports higher self-reliance (+3pp rural calibration). Quantitative evidence is not directly about self-reliance, but related items ('I only save for a specific purpose' at 35%, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 33%) are lower, but these are about specific behaviors or effort, not identity. The closest relevant evidence is the segment's demographic (older, semi-rural, likely to value self-reliance). Therefore, I slightly increase the baseline to reflect the segment's likely higher self-reliance. Final estimate: SA 28%, A 34%, N 18%, D 12%, SD 8%.
Run 2: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is supported by the segment's qualitative profile: older, semi-rural, likely home-owning couples approaching or in retirement—demographics that tend to value self-reliance and personal responsibility. Quantitative evidence is not directly on this concept, but related items ('I only save for a specific purpose' at 35% agreement and 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 33%) are lower, but these are about specific behaviors or effort, not identity. The closest relevant baseline is the Self-Reliance Identity category, so I use its distribution (SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%) and slightly increase SA (+3pp) and A (+1pp) due to the segment's older, semi-rural, likely more self-reliant profile. The result is 62% agreement, matching the expected pattern for this type of identity statement in this demographic. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and demographic alignment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=11.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a statement about personal responsibility and competence, and such attitudes are generally viewed positively and are subject to social desirability bias. The segment is older, semi-rural, and likely to have higher socioeconomic status (retired, sizeable properties), which may slightly increase agreement due to traditional values and self-reliance. Quantitative evidence is only weakly related: 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' is low (15%), but this is about behavior, not attitude; 'I only save for a specific purpose' (35%) and 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' (33%) are effort/behavior items, not identity. No direct evidence contradicts the baseline. Therefore, I use the Self-Reliance Identity baseline (SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%), and calibrate up slightly (+2pp to agreement) for older, semi-rural, higher-SES segment. Final: SA 28%, A 36%, N 18%, D 11%, SD 7%.
Run 4: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is reinforced by the segment's qualitative profile: older, semi-rural, likely home-owning couples approaching or in retirement—demographics that tend to value self-reliance and personal responsibility. Quantitative evidence is only weakly related: 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' is low (15%), but this measures behavior, not attitude. The closest attitude item ('I only save for a specific purpose', 35%) is lower, but not directly about responsibility. No strong evidence contradicts the baseline. Demographic calibration: semi-rural and older (+3pp for self-reliance). Therefore, I use the Self-Reliance Identity baseline (SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%) and slightly adjust up for age/rurality. Confidence is high due to strong semantic fit and supportive qualitative context.
Run 5: Strongly agree=27.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is supported by the segment's qualitative profile: older, semi-rural, likely home-owning couples approaching or in retirement—demographics that tend to value self-reliance and personal responsibility. Quantitative evidence is limited but relevant: only 15% plan to use 'other investments for retirement' (suggesting most see it as their own responsibility, not relying on external sources), and the 'I only save for a specific purpose' (35%) and 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' (33%) both indicate moderate but not high proactive financial behaviors. No evidence directly contradicts the self-reliance baseline, and the demographic (older, semi-rural) slightly boosts agreement (+3pp). Therefore, the estimate is slightly above the category baseline: SA 27%, A 36%, N 18%, D 12%, SD 7%.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category baseline, which is appropriate given the evidence. Quantitative data (moderate engagement in sporting events, high utility outgoings) and qualitative notes (leisure-focused interests) are correctly interpreted as not indicating unusually high proactivity or effort tolerance. The argument that high utility costs might motivate switching is acknowledged but not over-weighted, given the lack of direct evidence for proactive behavior. The topline distribution is well-supported by both the category norm and the available evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category, which typically sees low agreement (~30%) due to time/effort aversion, even when there is a potential for cost savings. The quantitative evidence shows that only about 25% of this segment visits sporting events (a moderate engagement in non-essential activities), and their outgoings on utilities are substantial, but there is no direct evidence of high engagement with switching or proactive financial behaviors. Qualitative notes suggest leisure interests rather than strong cost-saving or effortful behaviors. Therefore, the baseline for effort-required behaviors (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is appropriate. No strong demographic or evidence-based reason to adjust the baseline significantly. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). This is because switching utilities, while potentially cost-saving, is widely perceived as requiring significant time and hassle, and most people are effort-averse for such tasks. Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting the segment pays attention to these costs), but only about 25% visit sporting events (a moderate engagement in effortful leisure activities), and qualitative notes emphasize entertainment rather than proactive, effortful behaviors. There is no direct evidence of high engagement in switching or similar proactive financial behaviors. Therefore, the baseline is maintained, with a slight upward nudge for cost-consciousness (since utilities are a major expense), but not enough to shift the category. The final estimate is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with established category patterns and supporting evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement. This is because switching utilities, while potentially cost-saving, is widely perceived as requiring significant time and hassle, and most people are effort-averse for such tasks. Quantitative evidence shows that only about 25% of this segment visits sporting events (a moderate engagement activity), and only 12% visit places of worship (low engagement), suggesting a generally low propensity for effortful, non-routine activities. Outgoings on utilities are high, but this does not directly translate to willingness to switch—just that utilities are a significant expense. Qualitative notes (football, music, online games) suggest leisure preferences, not proactive effort in financial matters. No evidence suggests this segment is unusually proactive or effort-seeking. Therefore, the baseline for effort-required behaviors is appropriate, and the evidence supports a distribution close to the category norm: 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 25% slightly disagree, 15% strongly disagree.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). This is because switching utilities, while potentially cost-saving, is widely perceived as requiring significant time and hassle, and most people are effort-averse for such tasks. Quantitative evidence shows that this segment spends a substantial amount on utilities (4760.76 per year), which could motivate switching, but only about 25% visit sporting events (a proxy for willingness to engage in planned, effortful activities), and qualitative notes emphasize leisure and entertainment rather than proactive financial management. There is no strong evidence that this group is unusually proactive or effort-tolerant. Therefore, the baseline is maintained. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the semantic category and supporting evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category, which typically sees low agreement (~30%) due to time/effort aversion, even when potential savings exist. Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (4760.76 per year), indicating a strong financial incentive, but only about 25% visit sporting events (a moderate engagement in non-essential activities), and qualitative notes emphasize leisure over proactive financial management. No direct evidence suggests this segment is unusually proactive about switching. Thus, the baseline (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is maintained, with no strong demographic or behavioral reason to adjust upward. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant financial context.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.80
Critic confidence: 0.92
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the quantitative toplines, particularly the relatively low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks and pet care), which supports the idea that a significant portion of this segment may still prefer or be comfortable with cash. The higher online rates for home appliances and holiday/travel are acknowledged as evidence of digital adoption, but not enough to warrant a departure from the baseline. The qualitative note about ethical values is correctly identified as not directly relevant to payment method preference. The repeated use of the baseline and the explicit connection to the quantitative evidence demonstrate a methodologically sound approach. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 24.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.80 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The statement 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the payment method preference category, which typically sees moderate agreement (~35-40%) due to generational and situational variation. The quantitative evidence about online purchasing rates for various categories (alcoholic drinks 26%, pet care 34%, home appliances 56%, holiday/travel 72%) suggests that for everyday items, online (and thus non-cash) purchasing is still a minority behavior, especially for alcohol and pet care. This supports the idea that a significant portion of the population still prefers or is comfortable with cash, especially for lower-value or habitual purchases. The qualitative note about ethical values is not directly relevant to payment method preference. No strong demographic calibration is indicated for this segment, so the baseline is used. The resulting estimate is: Strongly agree 13%, Slightly agree 24%, Neither 28%, Slightly disagree 22%, Strongly disagree 13%.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of 37% agreement (13% strongly agree, 24% slightly agree). Quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for categories like alcoholic drinks (26%) and pet care (34%), but higher for home appliances (56%) and holiday/travel (72%). This suggests a moderate but not overwhelming preference for digital payments, with cash still relevant for certain categories. The qualitative note about ethical values does not directly affect payment method preference. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Therefore, the baseline distribution is maintained, with moderate confidence due to the partial relevance of the quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of 37% agreement (SA 13%, A 24%). The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for categories like alcoholic drinks (26%) and pet care (34%), suggesting this segment is less digitally oriented than average, which supports a moderate preference for cash. However, higher online rates for home appliances (56%) and especially holiday/travel (72%) indicate some digital adoption, so the baseline should not be increased. The qualitative note about ethical values does not directly affect payment method preference. Therefore, the baseline distribution is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence about online purchasing behavior, which inversely correlates with cash preference.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of 37% agreement (SA 13%, A 24%). The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for categories like alcoholic drinks (26%) and pet care (34%), suggesting this segment is less digitally oriented than average, which may correlate with a higher preference for cash. However, for home appliances (56%) and holiday/travel (72%), online purchase rates are higher, indicating some digital adoption. The qualitative note about ethical values does not directly affect payment method preference. Given the mixed digital adoption, I retain the category baseline without significant upward or downward adjustment. The final estimate is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13%. Confidence is moderately high due to the alignment of evidence with the category baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of 37% agreement (13% strongly agree, 24% slightly agree). The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for categories like alcoholic drinks (26%) and pet care (34%), suggesting a moderate to high preference for offline (potentially cash) transactions in these segments. However, higher online rates for home appliances (56%) and especially holiday/travel (72%) indicate that for some purchases, digital payments are more common. The qualitative note about ethical values does not directly affect cash preference. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Therefore, the baseline is maintained, with slight reinforcement from the lower online purchase rates in some categories. Confidence is high due to the direct relevance of the quantitative evidence.
