### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.70
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale correctly identifies that the available quantitative toplines (country of birth, account management channels) do not directly pertain to the attitude concept in question, and the qualitative notes do not provide additional relevant context. Therefore, applying the V4 baseline for attitudes is appropriate. The repeated rationales consistently note the lack of direct evidence for the specific attitude, supporting the use of the general template. No demographic or concept-specific correction is warranted based on the evidence. The confidence level is moderate-high, as the approach is methodologically sound given the constraints of the evidence.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated, and the provided quantitative evidence is not directly related to the target concept (it covers country of birth and account management channels, not attitudes). No strong demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence. Therefore, the general attitude template is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment with the V4 baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.70 / Rationale: The target concept is labeled as 'attitude', so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction or demographic calibration indicated by the provided context. The quantitative evidence provided relates to country of birth and account management preferences, but does not directly pertain to the attitude concept in question, so it does not warrant deviation from the baseline. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence for the specific attitude.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction or strong demographic calibration indicated by the provided evidence. The quantitative toplines are not directly related to the target concept, and the qualitative notes do not provide additional directional evidence. Therefore, the general V4 attitude template is used. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence for the specific concept.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.70 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline template is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. No concept-specific correction is indicated, as the target concept is generic ('Concept') and not one of the systematically miscalibrated items. The quantitative evidence provided relates to behaviors (e.g., managing accounts by phone, country of birth) but does not directly inform attitudes, so the baseline is most appropriate. No demographic calibration is applied, as the evidence does not indicate a strong deviation from the general population. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct attitudinal evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. No concept-specific correction is indicated, as the target concept is generic ('Concept') and not one of the systematically miscalibrated items. The quantitative evidence provided relates to behaviors (e.g., managing accounts by phone, country of birth) but does not directly inform attitudes, so it does not justify deviation from the baseline. No strong demographic calibration is warranted, as the values for country of birth and account management are low and do not indicate a strong attitudinal skew. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct attitudinal evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence: only 11% of this segment consider themselves environmentalists (very low), and 32% are skeptical of energy companies' environmental care (moderate skepticism). This supports the decision to use the V4 corrected baseline (which accounts for systematic over-prediction) and to avoid any upward demographic calibration. The minor downward adjustments in runs 4 and 5 are also well-justified by the direct evidence of low environmental self-identity. The absence of qualitative evidence is noted, but the high relevance and strength of the quantitative data compensate for this. Overall, the estimate is well-grounded in the provided evidence, and the confidence level is appropriately high.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 7.60%
  Slightly agree: 20.60%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.80%
  Slightly disagree: 23.80%
  Strongly disagree: 17.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), reflecting a -15pp correction for systematic over-prediction. Quantitative evidence shows only 11% of this segment consider themselves environmentalists (very low), and 32% are skeptical of energy companies' environmental care, suggesting moderate cynicism and low personal environmental identity. No evidence suggests this group is more pro-environment than the general baseline, so no upward demographic calibration is warranted. The estimate closely follows the V4 corrected baseline for this concept, with high confidence due to strong alignment between segment evidence and the cross-class correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4's cross-class analysis shows this item is systematically over-predicted, so the baseline is set at 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). For 'Up-and-coming Urbanites', the quantitative evidence shows only 11% consider themselves environmentalists and 32% are skeptical of energy companies' environmental care, both indicating low personal environmental engagement. No evidence suggests this segment is more pro-environment than the general population. Therefore, the general V4 correction (-15pp from V3) is applied without upward demographic adjustment. The result is a low agreement estimate, matching both the segment's weak environmental self-identity and the corrected cross-class baseline.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4's cross-class analysis shows systematic over-prediction for this concept, so the corrected baseline is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows only 11% consider themselves environmentalists (very low) and 32% think energy companies do not care about the environment (moderate skepticism), both suggesting lower-than-average environmental engagement. There is no evidence of higher pro-environmental attitudes in this segment, so no upward demographic calibration is justified. The V4 corrected baseline is therefore appropriate, and the evidence supports a low agreement estimate. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and high relevance of the provided data.
Run 4: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude'. V4 baseline for 'environmental sustainability when putting on events' is 8% SA, 22% A, 30% N, 23% D, 17% SD (30% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3. For 'Up-and-coming Urbanites', the direct quantitative evidence is: only 11% consider themselves environmentalists (very low), and 32% think energy companies do not care about the environment (moderate skepticism). This suggests even lower agreement than the V4 baseline, as environmental self-identity is weak in this segment. No qualitative evidence provided to counter this. Therefore, I adjust the agreement down by ~3pp (to 25% agreement), shifting slightly more to 'neither' and 'disagree'. Confidence is high due to strong direct quant evidence and high relevance.
Run 5: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=19.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events'), so the V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). For 'Up-and-coming Urbanites', the quantitative evidence shows only 11% consider themselves environmentalists (very low), and only 32% think energy companies do not care about the environment (moderate skepticism). This suggests lower-than-average environmental concern. Therefore, I slightly reduce agreement from the V4 baseline (from 8/22 to 7/19) and increase neutrality/disagreement. No strong demographic calibration is warranted, as the evidence is direct and highly relevant. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The prediction for 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' uses a well-calibrated baseline template (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%) as per V4 guidance for low-friction behaviors. The evidence from the 'Up-and-coming Urbanites' segment does not indicate any strong deviation from the general population for this specific attitude. Quantitative data on related attitudes (e.g., support for local businesses, digital engagement) and outgoings do not contradict the use of the baseline. The rationale is consistent across all runs, and the evidence hierarchy is respected. No further revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.00%
  Slightly agree: 40.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 15.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a low-friction behavior. According to the V4 prompt, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment 'Up-and-coming Urbanites' shows moderate digital engagement and a low rate of strong agreement with supporting local businesses (0.13), but there is no direct evidence suggesting a deviation from the general baseline. No demographic calibration is needed, as the evidence does not indicate a strong reason to adjust. Confidence is high due to the direct match with a well-calibrated template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a low-friction behavior (easy action, but not universally adopted). According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the standard template: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment 'Up-and-coming Urbanites' shows moderate digital engagement and a moderate tendency to support local businesses (0.13), but there is no direct evidence suggesting they are less likely than average to cut down on energy use. Outgoings on housing/utilities are high, which may incentivize energy-saving behaviors. No demographic calibration is needed. Therefore, the baseline V4 distribution is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the well-calibrated template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a low-friction behavior (easy action, but not universally practiced). According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the baseline: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment 'Up-and-coming Urbanites' shows moderate digital engagement and a low score for supporting local businesses (0.13), but there is no direct evidence suggesting they are less likely than average to try to cut down on utilities. No demographic calibration is needed. Therefore, the general baseline is applied. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the well-calibrated template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ("Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home"). According to V4, this is a well-calibrated concept (V3 error: -2.6pp), so the baseline template is retained: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment ('Up-and-coming Urbanites') shows moderate digital engagement and a low score for supporting local businesses (0.13), but there is no direct evidence suggesting a deviation from the general population for this specific energy-saving attitude. No demographic calibration is warranted. Quantitative evidence hierarchy is respected, and the prediction maintains the required variance. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the well-calibrated baseline and lack of contradictory segment evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ("make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home"). V4 guidance says this item is well-calibrated and should use the standard template: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment ('Up-and-coming Urbanites') shows moderate digital engagement and a low rate of strong agreement with supporting local businesses (0.13), but there is no direct evidence suggesting deviation from the general population for this specific energy-saving attitude. Outgoings on housing/utilities are not unusually high or low. Therefore, the general V4 baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct template match and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative anchor ('Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 46%), but correctly notes that this is a broader and less exclusive criterion than 'fuel consumption is the most important feature.' The estimate applies the V4 concept-specific baseline, which is appropriate given the evidence and the high-friction nature of the attitude being measured. Demographic calibration is considered but not over-applied, and the lack of strong qualitative evidence is acknowledged. The repeated cross-class consistency and systematic correction from V3 to V4 are well explained. No further revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 25.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' V4 baseline for this concept (after systematic correction) is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting consistent over-prediction in V3 and cross-class analysis. The closest quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 46%, but this is broader and more positive than 'fuel consumption is the most important feature,' which is a stricter criterion. No evidence suggests this segment (Up-and-coming Urbanites) would be higher than the general baseline; if anything, their urban, younger, and aspirational profile may prioritize style, tech, or price over fuel economy. No demographic calibration is warranted. The distribution is therefore set at the corrected V4 baseline for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class consistency and relevant quantitative anchors.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the V4 prompt specifies a concept-specific correction: for 'Fuel consumption important when buying car', reduce by -5pp from the V3 high-friction behavior baseline. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.46), which is higher than the V4 baseline (0.15 agreement), but this is a broader environmental concern, not specifically fuel consumption as the most important feature. The V4 template for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The segment (Up-and-coming Urbanites) is likely to be somewhat more environmentally conscious, but demographic calibrations are now halved (+2pp for young/urban), so at most this would nudge agreement to 17%. The direct evidence does not justify a higher estimate, as the question is about 'most important feature', which is a higher bar than simply 'important'. Therefore, the V4 concept-specific baseline is most appropriate, with only a minimal demographic adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the V4 correction and available quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' The V4 baseline for this concept is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3 and cross-class analysis. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.46), which is higher than the V4 baseline, but this item is not identical—environmental friendliness is broader than fuel consumption, and 'most important' is a high bar. The next most relevant attitude ('energy companies do not care about the environment', value=0.32) suggests moderate environmental concern, but not strong enough to shift the baseline. No qualitative evidence is provided to suggest a higher or lower value for this segment. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, with no demographic calibration (this segment is not flagged as high or low income, nor especially young/old). Confidence is high due to strong alignment with cross-class evidence and the lack of segment-specific deviation.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude' but with a high-friction behavioral implication (prioritizing fuel consumption above all else when buying a car). V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3 and cross-class analysis. Quantitative evidence from this segment shows 46% rate 'environmentally friendly/low CO2' as important when buying a car, but this is a broader, less exclusive criterion than 'fuel consumption is the most important feature.' The segment's environmental concern is moderate (32% agree energy companies don't care about the environment), but not dominant. No evidence suggests this group is more likely than average to prioritize fuel consumption above all else. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied without upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchor and cross-class consistency.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' V4 baseline for this concept is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3 and cross-class consistency. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.46), which is higher than the V4 baseline, but this item is broader (environmental concern, not just fuel consumption) and does not specify 'most important.' The segment (Up-and-coming Urbanites) is urban, younger, and likely to be more environmentally aware, but the V4 demographic calibration for 'young' is now only +3pp, and the concept-specific correction dominates. No qualitative evidence provided. The other attitudinal evidence ('energy companies do not care about the environment' at 0.32) suggests moderate environmental skepticism, which does not support a higher estimate. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is most appropriate, with no strong reason to adjust upward. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class consistency and relevant quantitative anchors.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.81
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently applies the well-calibrated V4 attitude baseline, which is appropriate for this type of concept in the absence of direct evidence about debt aversion. The quantitative evidence (risk tolerance, community engagement, climate change concern) is correctly interpreted as not indicating a major deviation from the general population baseline. The repeated rationale across runs demonstrates methodological consistency and careful consideration of the evidence hierarchy. Confidence is high due to the strong calibration of the baseline and the lack of contradictory or segment-specific evidence that would warrant adjustment. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), so the V4 attitude baseline applies: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, the segment 'Up-and-coming Urbanites' shows low community engagement (helping out: 11%) and moderate risk tolerance (27% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money'), suggesting a slightly higher tolerance for risk and possibly debt than average. There is no direct evidence for or against strong anti-debt sentiment, so the baseline is appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed as this is not a high-income or elderly group. The final estimate uses the V4 well-calibrated template for this concept, as V3 error was negligible. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment with the evidence and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), which uses the well-calibrated V4 baseline: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about debt aversion in the provided data, but the segment's risk tolerance (28% agree to risk-taking with money) is moderate, and community/helping-out scores are low (11%), suggesting a pragmatic, not highly risk-averse, but not reckless profile. The climate change concern (27%) is also moderate. No evidence suggests a major deviation from the general population for debt aversion. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to the strong evidence hierarchy and well-calibrated baseline for this concept.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' type, so the V4 baseline is SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence for attitudes to debt in this segment, but the available financial attitudes (27% agree to risk-taking with money) suggest a moderate openness to risk, which could slightly reduce aversion to debt, but not dramatically. The segment's low 'helping out in the community' (11%) and moderate agreement that climate change is a threat (27%) suggest a pragmatic, not highly idealistic, profile. No evidence suggests a major deviation from the V4 baseline. Therefore, I use the well-calibrated V4 template for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong template calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' type, so the V4 baseline is SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about debt aversion in the provided data, but the segment's low agreement with risk-taking (28%) and low community engagement (11%) suggest a moderate-to-low appetite for risk and social responsibility, which is consistent with moderate debt aversion. No evidence suggests this segment is unusually debt-tolerant or debt-averse compared to the general population. Therefore, the well-calibrated V4 baseline for this concept is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is high due to the strong evidence hierarchy and the absence of conflicting signals.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' type, so the V4 baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about debt aversion, but the segment's low community engagement (0.11) and moderate risk tolerance (0.28) suggest a slightly less risk-averse profile than average. However, the climate change concern (0.27) and likelihood to move (0.45) do not directly inform debt attitudes. No strong evidence to deviate from the well-calibrated V4 baseline for this concept, which is known to be accurate (V3 error -0.2pp). Therefore, I use the V4 attitude template unchanged. Confidence is high due to the well-calibrated baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.78
Critic confidence: 0.92
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I am very good at managing money' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently applies the V4 identity baseline, which is appropriate for this type of self-perception item. The quantitative evidence (e.g., 27% manage savings online, 58% privately own their main car) suggests moderate financial engagement and stability, but not at an exceptional level, supporting the use of the general baseline without further demographic calibration. The qualitative segment profile ('Up-and-Coming Urbanites') does not indicate a need for deviation from the baseline. There is no contradictory evidence, and the confidence level is appropriately set as moderate-high. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 34.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an identity statement ('I am very good at managing money'), so the V4 identity baseline is used: SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. The V4 cross-class correction for 'good at managing money' is to reduce agreement by 6pp from V3, resulting in SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). Quantitative evidence is limited but does not contradict this: 27% manage savings online (suggests moderate financial engagement), and the segment is 'Up-and-Coming Urbanites' (likely younger, aspirational, but not necessarily highly financially secure). No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the V4 corrected baseline. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory data.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: This is an IDENTITY-type item ('I am very good at managing money'). V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3 due to systematic over-prediction (+6pp in V3). The segment (Up-and-Coming Urbanites) is urban, relatively young, and digitally engaged (27% manage savings online, 58% own their main car), but there is no strong evidence of either high or low financial self-efficacy. No quantitative evidence directly contradicts or supports a deviation from the V4 baseline. Therefore, the general V4 template for this identity concept is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for this concept is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), which already incorporates a -6pp correction from V3 due to moderate over-prediction. The provided quantitative evidence does not directly address self-perceived money management skill, but the segment's moderate use of online savings accounts (27%) and a relatively high proportion of privately owned cars (58%) suggest some financial engagement and stability, but not at an exceptional level. There is no strong evidence to further adjust the baseline for this segment. Therefore, the V4 corrected identity baseline is applied directly. Confidence is moderate-high due to the alignment of segment characteristics with the general population and the lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for this concept is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), which is already adjusted down by 6pp from V3 due to moderate over-prediction. The quantitative evidence is limited but relevant: 26.7% manage savings online (suggesting some financial engagement), and 58% privately own their main car (implying some financial stability). However, these do not indicate unusually high or low self-perceived money management skill for this segment. The qualitative profile for 'Up-and-Coming Urbanites' does not suggest a need for further adjustment. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is moderate-high due to alignment with both the evidence and the well-calibrated V4 baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for this is SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), after correcting for a moderate over-prediction bias found in V3. The provided quantitative evidence (e.g., 27% manage savings accounts online, moderate car ownership, and high miscellaneous spending) does not suggest a significant deviation from the general population for this class. Qualitative notes do not indicate either a strong positive or negative outlier in money management self-perception. Therefore, the V4 corrected identity baseline is applied without further demographic calibration. Confidence is moderate-high due to the alignment of evidence and the well-calibrated baseline.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the well-calibrated V4 baseline for the attitude 'It is important to be well insured for everything,' citing strong quantitative evidence (notably, the low agreement with 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' at 10%) to support the segment's low prioritization of practical or risk-averse features. There is no qualitative evidence contradicting this, and the absence of demographic or other segment-specific factors further supports the use of the baseline. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the confidence in the estimate is appropriately high. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to the V4 baseline for this concept (which is well-calibrated and unchanged from V3), the expected distribution is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The segment 'Up-and-coming Urbanites' shows low agreement with other 'responsibility' or 'practicality' attitudes (e.g., only 10% agree that fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car), suggesting a low prioritization of practical/precautionary concerns. There is no evidence in the provided context to suggest a higher-than-baseline agreement. Therefore, the baseline is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment and the absence of contradictory qualitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this item is well-calibrated and should use the baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The quantitative evidence for this segment ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' at 10%) suggests a low tendency to prioritize practical, risk-averse features, which aligns with the lower agreement baseline. There is no evidence in the qualitative notes to suggest a higher or lower valuation of insurance. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied without demographic calibration, as 'Up-and-coming Urbanites' do not show strong deviation from the general population on this attitude. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative alignment and strong cross-class calibration for this concept.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('It is important to be well insured for everything'). According to V4, this is a well-calibrated concept, so we use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The quantitative evidence for this segment ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' = 0.10) suggests low prioritization of practical/financial caution, which aligns with the baseline. No qualitative evidence suggests a higher or lower valuation of insurance. Demographic calibrations are not applied as there is no strong evidence for deviation. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative alignment and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to the V4 baseline, this item is well-calibrated and should use the template: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence for this segment (Up-and-coming Urbanites) shows low prioritization of practical/financial caution (e.g., only 10% rate fuel consumption as most important when buying a car), and a focus on mass market and advertising, suggesting a younger, less risk-averse profile. There is no evidence to suggest this group would be more insurance-focused than the general population. Therefore, the baseline is appropriate, and no demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment characteristics and the well-calibrated baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this is a well-calibrated concept, so the baseline template is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence from this segment ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' at 10%) suggests a low tendency to prioritize risk-averse or practical features, which aligns with a lower agreement for insurance importance. There is no evidence in the qualitative notes to suggest a higher or lower value placed on insurance. No demographic calibration is needed, as the segment is not flagged as high or low income, nor elderly. The evidence hierarchy is satisfied by direct quantitative data, which supports the use of the baseline. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between the segment's risk/utility attitudes and the baseline calibration.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitude among 'Up-and-coming Urbanites' is well justified. The topline quantitative data clearly shows a low prevalence of vegan and vegetarian diets (1% and 4%, respectively), with the vast majority (76%) eating meat and a moderate minority (18%) pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This supports the rationale that strong healthy eating behaviors are not widespread in this segment. The application of the V4 cross-class correction (reducing agreement rates due to prior over-prediction) is appropriate and consistently applied across all runs. The lack of qualitative evidence for higher health focus is correctly noted, and no unwarranted demographic calibration is introduced. The confidence is high due to the strong alignment between the quantitative evidence and the correction methodology. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 11.60%
  Slightly agree: 25.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.40%
  Slightly disagree: 22.40%
  Strongly disagree: 14.40%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=24.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is much lower (SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%). For 'Up-and-coming Urbanites', quantitative data shows only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, 18% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, and 76% eat meat. This suggests a low prevalence of strong healthy eating behaviors, likely reflecting a lower attitude agreement as well. Therefore, I slightly reduce agreement further from the V4 baseline (SA 10%, A 22%) and increase disagreement (D 24%, SD 16%) to reflect the segment's actual eating patterns. No qualitative evidence suggests a higher health focus. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and V4's cross-class correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is now 38% agreement (SA+A). The quantitative evidence shows this segment is overwhelmingly meat-eating (76%), with very low vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) rates, and a moderate minority (18%) pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with health-focused or restrictive diets. This supports the V4 correction: agreement with 'Healthy Eating' is likely below average. No qualitative evidence contradicts this. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied without upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3 across all classes). The corrected baseline is: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14% (38% agreement). Quantitative evidence shows this segment is overwhelmingly omnivorous (76% eats meat, only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, 18% pescatarian/flexitarian), suggesting a lower prevalence of strong healthy eating attitudes than average. However, the V4 correction already accounts for this cross-class, and the segment is not notably healthier than average. No demographic calibration is needed. Therefore, the general V4 'Healthy Eating' correction is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and high consistency of the correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is set at 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows this segment is overwhelmingly meat-eating (76%), with very low vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) rates, and a moderate minority (18%) pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while a small group may be highly health-conscious, the majority are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-driven diets. However, 'Healthy Eating' as an attitude is broader than just diet type, so some moderate agreement is still plausible. No qualitative evidence is present to suggest a higher or lower adjustment. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and the use of a cross-class correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is now 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). Quantitative evidence shows this segment is overwhelmingly meat-eating (76%), with very low vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) rates, and a moderate pescatarian/flexitarian/other (18%). This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. However, 'healthy eating' as an attitude is broader than just meat avoidance, so the baseline correction is appropriate. No evidence suggests this segment is more health-focused than average, so no upward demographic calibration is applied. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and the use of the V4 cross-class correction.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run consistently references the V4 template for the attitude 'Retirement is your responsibility,' which is appropriate given the concept's framing. The quantitative evidence (13% plan to use other investments for retirement, 30% only save for a specific purpose) is correctly interpreted as not directly contradicting the attitude statement, since agreement with personal responsibility does not require proactive planning. The lack of strong qualitative or demographic evidence for deviation from the baseline is also correctly noted. The repeated application of the V4 baseline (25/35/18/13/9) is well-supported, and the confidence in the prediction is warranted given the alignment with both the template and the available evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.00%
  Slightly disagree: 13.00%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but closely borders on 'identity' for some, and the V4 template for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is 25/35/18/13/9 (60% agreement), reflecting a moderate consensus. The quantitative evidence shows low intent to use other investments for retirement (13%), suggesting limited proactive retirement planning, but this does not directly contradict the attitude that retirement is one's own responsibility—many may agree with the principle but not act on it. No evidence in the qualitative notes suggests a major deviation from the general population. Demographic calibration is not strongly indicated for 'Up-and-coming Urbanites' (younger, urban, moderate income), so the V4 baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the V4 template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' item, but the specific wording ('your own responsibility') aligns closely with the V4 template for 'Retirement is your responsibility', which is moderately over-predicted in V3 and thus receives a -3pp correction in V4. The Up-and-Coming Urbanites segment is younger and more urban, which in V4 receives a +3pp demographic calibration (reduced from +6pp in V3). Quantitative evidence is limited but relevant: only 13% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting low proactive planning), and 30% only save for a specific purpose (implying less general saving behavior). However, these do not directly contradict the attitude that retirement is one's own responsibility—they may recognize the responsibility but not act on it. Thus, the V4 corrected baseline (SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9%) is appropriate, with a slight upward nudge for the segment's youth (+3pp distributed proportionally across agreement categories). This results in a predicted agreement (SA+A) of 60%. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with V4 calibration and moderate supporting evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is used: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). The quantitative evidence shows low intent to use other investments for retirement (13%), which suggests relatively low proactive retirement planning, but this does not directly contradict the attitude of personal responsibility—many may agree it's their responsibility but not act on it. No evidence suggests this segment is unusually high or low on this attitude, so the general V4 baseline is appropriate. Demographic calibration is not applied as there is no strong evidence of deviation. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the V4 template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but with a strong 'identity' component for this segment, as it relates to personal responsibility for retirement. V4 guidance for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is to use 25/35/18/13/9 (60% agreement), based on moderate over-prediction in V3 and low cross-class consistency error. The quantitative evidence shows only 13% plan to use other investments for retirement, suggesting low proactive planning, but this does not directly contradict the attitude of believing retirement is one's own responsibility—many may agree with the principle but not act on it. No strong qualitative evidence is present to shift the baseline. Demographic calibration is not applied, as 'Up-and-coming Urbanites' are not strongly skewed by age or income in the evidence provided. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline for this concept is applied. Confidence is high due to direct V4 calibration and moderate relevance of the quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but closely borders on 'identity' for some segments. V4 guidance for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is to use 25/35/18/13/9 (60% agreement), based on moderate over-prediction in V3 and cross-class analysis. The quantitative evidence for this segment shows low intent to use other investments for retirement (13%), but this does not directly contradict the attitude of personal responsibility—it may reflect low means or opportunity, not low agreement with the principle. Other financial attitudes (saving for a purpose, trust in comparison sites, switching utilities) are not directly relevant but suggest moderate financial engagement. No evidence suggests this segment is unusually high or low on this attitude, so the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate. Demographic calibration is not applied, as 'Up-and-coming Urbanites' are not flagged for strong deviation. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.81
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the well-calibrated V4 baseline for this attitude item, as there is no direct evidence in the segment data to suggest deviation from the general population. The quantitative evidence (notably high outgoings on council tax, utilities, etc.) is acknowledged but correctly interpreted as not indicative of a higher or lower propensity to switch suppliers. The qualitative context is minimal, and the evidence hierarchy is respected. Confidence is high due to the strong alignment with the evidence and the well-calibrated nature of the baseline. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 baseline for this type is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence in the segment data about switching utilities, but the relatively high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related bills (3179.69) suggest that utilities are a notable expense for this group. However, there is no evidence that this group is especially proactive or resistant to switching, so the general baseline is appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed, as 'Up-and-coming Urbanites' do not fit the high/low income or age extremes. Confidence is moderate-high due to the alignment with the well-calibrated V4 baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is an attitude item. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated (V3 error -2.1pp), so the baseline template is retained: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. The segment 'Up-and-coming Urbanites' shows moderate outgoings on utilities and housing, but there is no direct evidence of unusually high or low engagement with switching. Quantitative data on utilities spending is present but does not indicate a strong deviation from the general population. Therefore, the general baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct alignment with the well-calibrated template and lack of segment-specific evidence to justify deviation.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. The segment 'Up-and-coming Urbanites' shows moderate engagement with outgoings (notably high council tax/utilities spend), but there is no direct evidence of higher or lower switching propensity. Quantitative evidence is neutral, and qualitative context is minimal. Therefore, the general template is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the well-calibrated nature of this concept in V4.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated (V3 error: -2.1pp), so the baseline template is retained: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. The segment 'Up-and-coming Urbanites' shows moderate outgoings on utilities and housing, but there is no strong evidence of unusually high or low engagement with utility switching. Quantitative data on outgoings (council tax, utilities, etc.) is typical, and there is no qualitative evidence suggesting a deviation from the general population. Therefore, the general attitude baseline is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the well-calibrated nature of this concept in V4.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence shows moderate outgoings on utilities (council tax, utilities, water, etc.), but there is no direct evidence of high engagement or friction with switching. The segment ('Up-and-coming Urbanites') does not show strong deviation from the general population in this domain, and no demographic calibration is warranted. Therefore, the general baseline is applied. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the well-calibrated status of this concept in V4.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the quantitative toplines, which show a mixed digital adoption profile for Up-and-Coming Urbanites: high online purchase rates for big-ticket/planned items (home appliances, travel) and lower for everyday items (alcohol, pet care). This supports the application of the V4 baseline for cash preference, as there is no strong evidence of deviation from the general population. The qualitative notes and demographic considerations are also appropriately weighed, with no indication of a strong cash preference or aversion. The repeated application of the V4 baseline is well-supported by the evidence, and confidence is high due to the alignment between the toplines and the attitude estimate. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 24.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.84 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For V4, the general baseline for 'like to use cash' is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate but not high preference for cash. Quantitative evidence shows that for Up-and-Coming Urbanites, online purchase rates are moderate to high for some categories (e.g., 51% for home appliances, 67% for travel), but much lower for everyday items like alcohol (22%) and pet care (21%). This suggests a mixed digital adoption: they are comfortable online for big-ticket or planned purchases, but may still use cash for everyday or impulse buys. No evidence suggests a strong deviation from the V4 baseline for this concept in this segment. Qualitative notes do not indicate a strong cash preference or aversion. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For V4, the general baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate spread and a slight downward correction from V3 due to mild over-prediction. Quantitative evidence shows that Up-and-Coming Urbanites have relatively low online purchase rates for categories like alcohol (22%) and pet care (21%), but higher for home appliances (51%) and holiday/travel (67%). This suggests a mixed digital adoption profile, but not a strong cash preference. No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the V4 baseline for this concept. Demographic calibration is not applied, as this segment is not strongly skewed toward cash usage. Confidence is high due to alignment between the baseline and the segment's digital behavior.

Quantitative evidence from the segment shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 22%, pet care 21%), but higher for home appliances (51%) and holiday/travel (67%). This suggests that while Up-and-Coming Urbanites are comfortable with online purchases for big-ticket or infrequent items, they are less so for everyday purchases, which may correlate with a moderate preference for cash for routine transactions. However, as an urban, younger, and likely tech-savvy segment, their cash preference is not expected to be high. No strong demographic calibration is warranted (urbanites, likely younger, so no +3pp). The V4 baseline is therefore appropriate, with no further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and well-calibrated V4 baseline.

  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For V4, the general baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate but not high preference for cash. The quantitative evidence shows that Up-and-Coming Urbanites have relatively high online purchase rates for home appliances (51%) and holiday/travel (67%), but much lower for alcohol (22%) and pet care (21%). This suggests a segment that is comfortable with digital payments for larger or planned purchases, but may still use cash for smaller, everyday items. However, the overall pattern is more digital than average, so if anything, the baseline may slightly overstate cash preference for this group. Still, the V4 correction for this concept is already modest (-3pp from V3), and the evidence does not justify a further reduction. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and a well-calibrated baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For V4, the general baseline for this attitude is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate spread and correcting for V3's slight over-prediction. Quantitative evidence shows that Up-and-Coming Urbanites have relatively high online purchase rates for home appliances (51%) and holiday/travel (67%), but much lower for alcohol (22%) and pet care (21%). This suggests a mixed digital adoption profile: they are comfortable online for larger or planned purchases, but may still use cash for everyday or lower-value items. No strong qualitative evidence suggests a major deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, with no further demographic calibration needed. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors and the concept's moderate consistency error in prior rounds.
