### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.70
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The quantitative toplines relate to demographic and behavioral variables (country of birth, account management by phone), but these are not directly tied to the attitudinal concept being measured. The values are low and do not suggest a strong need for demographic calibration. The qualitative notes are generic and do not provide additional direction. Therefore, applying the V4 baseline for attitudes is methodologically sound in this context. The rationale for each run is consistent and appropriately cautious, noting the lack of direct evidence for the specific concept. Confidence is moderate to high due to strong protocol alignment and absence of contradictory evidence.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated, and the quantitative evidence provided is not directly related to the target concept but rather to demographic and behavioral variables (e.g., country of birth, managing accounts by phone). No strong demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence, as the values are low and not directly tied to attitudinal agreement. Therefore, the general attitude baseline is used. Confidence is moderate, as the evidence is not directly about the concept but supports the use of the general template.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.70 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction required, as the context does not match any of the high-consistency error concepts (e.g., healthy eating, environmental sustainability, etc.). The quantitative evidence provided is not directly related to the target concept, so it does not warrant a deviation from the baseline. No demographic calibration is applied, as the evidence is not strongly indicative of a need for adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence for the specific concept.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated, and no strong demographic calibration is warranted from the provided evidence (the quantitative toplines are not directly related to the attitude concept and have low values, suggesting little need for adjustment). The qualitative notes do not provide additional direction. Therefore, the general V4 attitude baseline is used. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence for this specific concept in this segment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. No concept-specific correction is indicated, as the target concept is generic ('Concept') and no anchor or prior distribution is provided. The quantitative evidence provided relates to demographics and banking behaviors, but does not directly inform attitudes toward the unspecified concept. Therefore, the general attitude baseline is most appropriate. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment with the V4 protocol and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline template is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The provided quantitative evidence is not directly related to the target concept (it covers country of birth and current account management by phone), and the qualitative notes are generic. No concept-specific or demographic corrections are indicated by the evidence. Therefore, the general V4 attitude baseline is the most appropriate estimate. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.87
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence: extremely low self-identification as environmentalist (7%) and low trust in energy companies' environmental concern (27%), both well below general population baselines. The V4 baseline and its systematic correction for over-prediction are clearly explained, and the further downward adjustment for this segment is well-supported by the evidence hierarchy. The distribution of responses is transparently derived, and the confidence in the estimate is appropriately high given the strong quantitative alignment. No contradictory qualitative evidence is present. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 5.60%
  Slightly agree: 15.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 31.20%
  Slightly disagree: 27.80%
  Strongly disagree: 20.40%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=16.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=19.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events'). The V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3. For 'hard-up households', the quantitative evidence shows extremely low self-identification as environmentalist (7%) and low trust in energy companies' environmental concern (27%), both much lower than general population baselines. This suggests even lower agreement than the V4 baseline. No qualitative evidence contradicts this. Therefore, I reduce agreement by 6pp (to 22%), shifting more into 'neither' and 'disagree'. This is consistent with the evidence hierarchy: direct quant data (7% environmentalist) strongly suggests low engagement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=16.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=19.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4's cross-class correction for this concept is to reduce agreement by -15pp from V3, yielding a general population baseline of 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). However, the segment 'Hard-up Households' shows extremely low self-identification as environmentalists (7%) and low trust in energy companies' environmental care (27%), both well below national averages. This suggests even lower agreement than the already-reduced V4 baseline. Applying a further downward adjustment (approx -6pp to agreement, distributed proportionally), the estimate is: strongly agree 6%, slightly agree 16%, neither 32%, slightly disagree 27%, strongly disagree 19%. This reflects both the V4 correction and the segment's especially low environmental engagement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=24.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability, for the 'hard-up households' segment. V4's cross-class analysis shows systematic over-prediction for this concept, so the baseline is reduced to 8% SA, 22% A, 30% N, 23% D, 17% SD (30% agreement). However, the segment's own quantitative data shows extremely low self-identification as environmentalist (7%) and low trust in energy companies' environmental concern (27% agree), both indicating even lower pro-environmental attitudes than the general population. Therefore, I further reduce agreement by ~5pp, shifting more to disagreement. This yields 5% SA, 13% A, 28% N, 30% D, 24% SD. This is consistent with both the V4 correction and the segment's specific evidence. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=16.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=19.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: This is an attitude item for the 'hard-up households' segment. The V4 baseline for 'environmental sustainability when putting on events' is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), reflecting a -15pp correction for systematic over-prediction. 

Segment-specific quantitative evidence shows very low environmental self-identification (7% agree they are environmentalists) and low trust in energy companies (27% agree they do not care about the environment), both indicating low environmental engagement. This suggests the segment is even less likely than the general population to agree with the target statement. 

Therefore, I further reduce agreement by ~4pp (relative to V4 baseline) to reflect this segment's lower environmental concern, resulting in 22% agreement (6% strongly agree, 16% slightly agree). The 'neither' and 'disagree' categories are increased accordingly. This is supported by direct quantitative evidence (weight 80%) and aligns with the V4 cross-class correction for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=14.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=21.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events'), which in V4 has a general baseline of 10% strongly agree, 27% slightly agree, 28% neither, 20% slightly disagree, 15% strongly disagree. However, for this specific concept, V4 mandates a major downward correction (-15pp) due to systematic over-prediction across all classes, so the corrected baseline is 8% SA, 22% A, 30% N, 23% D, 17% SD. 

For 'Hard-up Households', the segment quantitative toplines show extremely low self-identification as environmentalist (7%) and low trust in energy companies' environmental concern (27%). These are both well below national averages and indicate a low salience of environmental attitudes in this group. This justifies a further downward adjustment from the V4 corrected baseline. 

Given the evidence, I reduce both agreement categories by 3pp each and increase disagreement by 4pp (split between D and SD), with a slight increase in 'neither' to reflect likely disengagement. Final estimate: SA 5%, A 14%, N 32%, D 28%, SD 21%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and the V4 cross-class correction.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the high outgoings on housing and utilities (77.25), which is strong quantitative evidence for a high motivation to economize on energy use. The V4 baseline for this concept is well-calibrated and appropriate for this segment, and the evidence hierarchy is respected by not over-calibrating for demographics. There is no contradictory evidence from digital or financial attitudes, and the qualitative context, while minimal, does not undermine the estimate. The repeated application of the V4 template is methodologically sound given the evidence and calibration guidance. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.00%
  Slightly agree: 40.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 15.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an 'attitude' item, but the specific concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home') is well-calibrated in V4 and should use the unchanged template: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. The segment ('Hard-up Households') has very high outgoings on housing and utilities (77.25%), which strongly suggests a high motivation to reduce energy use. No direct quantitative evidence for this exact item is given, but the context (financial pressure, low digital engagement, low local business support) does not contradict the baseline. The evidence hierarchy prioritizes the well-calibrated V4 baseline, and demographic calibration is not needed as this item is already well-calibrated for lower-income groups. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence and the V4 template.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but specifically about energy-saving behavior, which is well-calibrated in V4 (no systematic over/under-prediction). The V4 baseline for 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home' is: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. Quantitative evidence from this segment shows high outgoings on housing and utilities (77.25), which likely increases motivation to cut down on energy use. There is no evidence of digital or financial attitudes that would reduce this tendency. The qualitative context is minimal, but nothing contradicts the baseline. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment and the concept being well-calibrated in V4.
Run 3: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a low-friction behavior (easy, cost-saving, and salient for financially constrained groups). V4 guidance indicates this item is well-calibrated and should use the general template: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment ('Hard-up Households') shows very high outgoings on housing and utilities (77.25), suggesting strong motivation to economize. No direct quantitative anchor for this specific item, but the segment's financial pressure and likely cost-consciousness support the baseline or even a slight upward nudge. However, V4 instructs to keep the well-calibrated template unchanged. Qualitative context is minimal, but nothing contradicts the baseline. Therefore, I use the V4 template for this concept and segment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment characteristics and the concept's nature.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a 'Behavior (Low Friction)' but is treated as a well-calibrated concept in V4 (error < 3pp), so the V3 baseline is retained: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. The segment 'Hard-up Households' has high outgoings on housing and utilities (77.25), which suggests strong motivation to economize on energy. There is no direct quantitative evidence for this specific behavior, but the general context of financial constraint supports the baseline or possibly a slight upward calibration. However, V4 guardrails advise not to over-calibrate for demographics, and the baseline already reflects high agreement. Therefore, the standard distribution is used. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment context and the well-calibrated baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the baseline: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment 'Hard-up Households' shows high outgoings on housing and utilities (77.25), which suggests a strong financial incentive to reduce energy use. There is no direct quantitative evidence for this specific item, but the general context of financial constraint supports the baseline or even a slight upward adjustment. However, V4 instructs to keep well-calibrated concepts unchanged, so the baseline is applied. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment context and the general population baseline for this item.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative anchor ('Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 34%) and correctly notes that this is a broader and less stringent criterion than the target concept ('most important feature'). The V4 baseline (15% agreement) is appropriately used, with clear explanation that the segment's economic constraints and the stricter wording of the target concept justify a lower estimate than the topline anchor. The repeated runs demonstrate strong cross-class consistency, and the decision not to apply further demographic calibration is well-supported by the evidence. Confidence is high due to the alignment between the quantitative anchor, the V4 correction, and the segment context. No further revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 25.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' V4 guidance for this concept (see 'Fuel consumption important when buying car') is to REDUCE by -5pp from V3, due to systematic over-prediction (+5.2pp error, consistency score 2.1). The corrected V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). 

Segment quantitative evidence is moderately supportive: 34% say 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' is important when buying a car (relevance 0.98), but this is not the same as 'most important' and is likely to overstate agreement with the much stronger statement in the target concept. Other evidence (attitudes to energy companies, insurance, online research) is less directly relevant. The segment is 'Hard-up Households', which may further reduce agreement due to price sensitivity and cost being a more likely top priority than fuel consumption. However, V4 demographic calibrations are now reduced by 50%, so only a minor downward adjustment is warranted (if any). 

Therefore, I use the V4 corrected baseline for this concept, with no further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class consistency and direct quantitative anchor.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about fuel consumption being the most important feature when buying a new car. The closest quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 34% for this segment (Hard-up Households). This is a related but not identical concept; 'fuel consumption' is a narrower, more cost-focused concern, while 'environmentally friendly' is broader and may be less salient for this segment. V4's cross-class correction for this concept is to use the 'fuel consumption important when buying car' template: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), which is lower than the 34% anchor, reflecting the more stringent wording ('most important feature') and the segment's likely cost sensitivity but also limited ability to prioritize environmental or efficiency features due to budget constraints. The evidence hierarchy is led by the quantitative anchor (value=0.34), but the V4 template is lower to correct for systematic over-prediction. No strong demographic calibration is needed, as Hard-up Households are not likely to over-index on this attitude. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and V4's cross-class correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but it is also high-friction in this context because 'Hard-up Households' are likely to prioritize price, reliability, and necessity over environmental or fuel efficiency concerns. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 34%, which is higher than the V4 baseline for this concept (15% agreement), but this item is about environmental friendliness, not specifically fuel consumption. The V4 cross-class correction for this concept is to use a low baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%. The evidence from this segment does not suggest a higher agreement than the general population, and the demographic (financially constrained) would likely further reduce the proportion who prioritize fuel consumption above all else. Therefore, I use the V4 corrected baseline for this concept, with no upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class consistency.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the context and quantitative evidence suggest a relatively low level of agreement among 'Hard-up Households.' The most relevant quantitative topline is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 34%, which is higher than the V4 baseline for this concept (15% agreement), but the specific focus on 'most important feature' (fuel consumption) is a stricter criterion than simply considering environmental friendliness. The V4 template for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%. The evidence does not justify increasing agreement, as the 34% topline likely includes those who consider it 'important' but not necessarily 'most important.' The qualitative context (not provided in detail) and other attitudes (e.g., skepticism about energy companies' environmental care) do not suggest a strong pro-environmental or fuel-economy focus. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, and no demographic uplift is applied (as 'Hard-up Households' are not coded for higher agreement on this item). Confidence is high due to strong alignment between the V4 template and the quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the context and quantitative evidence suggest it is a high-friction behavioral attitude for this segment (Hard-up Households). The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 34%, which is higher than the V4 baseline for this concept (15% agreement), but the question is more general and less restrictive than 'most important feature.' V4's cross-class correction for this concept is to use a low baseline (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%), reflecting that only a minority prioritize fuel consumption above all else. The segment's economic constraints may increase sensitivity to running costs, but the evidence does not show a strong majority prioritizing this above all else. The 34% figure likely includes those who consider it important, not necessarily most important. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, and no upward demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class consistency.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.81
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the V4 baseline, which is described as well-calibrated for this attitude item. The quantitative evidence from the 'Hard-up Households' segment (low community engagement, low risk tolerance, moderate climate concern) is considered, but none of these indicators directly suggest a deviation from the baseline for debt aversion. The absence of strong qualitative evidence is noted, but the protocol's guidance to retain the baseline in the absence of contradictory evidence is followed. The confidence is high due to the direct match between the concept type and the template, and the lack of evidence requiring adjustment. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), which is well-calibrated in V4 and does not require systematic correction. The segment ('Hard-up Households') shows low agreement with pro-social and risk-averse attitudes (e.g., only 6% help out in the community, 20% are risk-tolerant, 24% see climate change as a threat). These suggest a population with lower engagement and possibly higher financial stress, but not necessarily a higher tolerance for debt. The V4 baseline for this attitude is: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (43% agreement). No strong evidence to adjust up or down, so the baseline is retained. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative calibration and lack of conflicting evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'). According to V4, this item is well-calibrated and should use the standard template: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The segment ('Hard-up Households') shows low engagement in community (6%) and low agreement with risk-taking (20%), suggesting risk aversion but also possible resignation to financial constraints. However, the V4 template is already calibrated for general UK population and is not adjusted for this segment, as the evidence does not indicate a strong deviation from the norm. Quantitative evidence is limited but does not contradict the baseline. Confidence is high due to direct template match and lack of conflicting evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), and the V4 baseline for this item is well-calibrated (43% agreement: 18% strongly agree, 25% slightly agree). The segment, 'Hard-up Households,' shows low engagement in community helping (6%), low risk tolerance (20%), and moderate concern for climate change (24%). These suggest a cautious, risk-averse profile, which would typically be associated with a higher dislike of debt. However, the V4 protocol instructs to keep the baseline for this concept unchanged, as it is already well-calibrated across all classes. No strong quantitative evidence suggests a need to adjust the baseline up or down for this segment. Therefore, the standard V4 distribution is applied. Confidence is high due to the direct match of concept type and the absence of evidence requiring deviation from the baseline.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude item. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the standard template: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The segment 'Hard-up Households' shows low engagement in community (6%), low risk tolerance (20%), and moderate concern for climate change (24%), all suggesting a cautious, risk-averse profile. However, there is no direct evidence that this group is more or less averse to debt than the general population. The V4 baseline is therefore appropriate, with no demographic calibration needed. Confidence is high due to the strong alignment with the well-calibrated template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'). According to V4, this item is well-calibrated and should use the standard attitude template (SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence for this segment ('Hard-up Households') shows low engagement in community helping (6%), low risk tolerance (20%), and moderate concern about climate change (24%). None of these directly contradict the baseline, and there is no evidence that this group is unusually tolerant of debt. The qualitative context is missing, so no further adjustment is warranted. Therefore, the standard V4 attitude distribution is applied. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.79
Critic confidence: 0.92
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I am very good at managing money' among 'Hard-up Households' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale for downward adjustment from the V4 general population baseline is well-supported by indirect quantitative evidence: low rates of online savings management (0.18) and high outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services (30.3%) both suggest lower financial engagement and possible financial stress. The absence of direct self-assessment data is acknowledged, and the adjustment is moderate, not excessive, reflecting the identity nature of the item (self-perception may remain somewhat resilient even under constraint). The run-level detail shows careful calibration and consideration of variance. Confidence is moderate-high due to the strong alignment between the segment profile and the quantitative signals. No major revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 21.60%
  Slightly agree: 31.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 21.60%
  Slightly disagree: 15.60%
  Strongly disagree: 10.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=20.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=11.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Concept type is 'identity' (self-assessment of money management skill). V4 baseline for 'good at managing money' is SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), but this is for general population. 'Hard-up households' are likely to have lower financial confidence due to economic constraints, as suggested by high outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services and low online savings management (0.18). No direct quantitative evidence on self-perceived money management, but indirect evidence (low digital engagement, economic hardship) supports lowering agreement by ~9pp (to 50% agreement). Distribution is shifted downward, with more in 'neither' and 'disagree' categories. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong segment evidence and robust V4 calibration.
Run 2: Strongly agree=21.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Concept type is 'Identity' (self-assessment of financial skill). V4 baseline for 'good at managing money' is 25% SA, 34% A, 20% N, 12% D, 9% SD (59% agreement), but this is for general population. 'Hard-up households' are likely to have lower financial confidence due to economic constraints, as suggested by high outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services and low online savings management (0.18). No direct quantitative evidence of self-assessed money management, but indirect evidence (low digital savings engagement, likely financial stress) suggests agreement will be lower than baseline. Adjusted downward by ~8pp (relative to V4 baseline) to reflect this, resulting in 51% agreement (SA+A). Maintained variance and did not over-correct, as some in this segment may still feel competent at managing limited resources. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong indirect quantitative evidence and robust V4 calibration.
Run 3: Strongly agree=20.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=11.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. V4 baseline for this is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10% (57% agreement), but for 'Good at managing money' the cross-class correction is -6pp (SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% → 59% agreement). However, this segment ('Hard-up Households') is likely to have lower financial confidence due to economic constraints. Quantitative evidence shows only 18% manage savings online (suggesting low engagement/confidence), and qualitative profiles for this group typically indicate financial stress. Therefore, I reduce agreement by ~9pp from the V4 identity baseline, resulting in 50% agreement (SA 20%, A 30%). This maintains variance and reflects both the identity nature of the item and the segment's likely lower self-assessed financial competence. The distribution is slightly more neutral/disagree than the general population. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between quantitative and qualitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an IDENTITY item. V4 baseline for this is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. The segment is 'Hard-up Households', which are likely to have lower financial confidence and capability than average. However, the V4 correction for this concept is already -6pp from V3, and the demographic calibration for low income is now only +4pp (down from +8pp in V3). Quantitative evidence shows only 18% manage savings accounts online (suggesting lower financial engagement), and qualitative evidence (not shown in detail) likely supports financial constraint. However, the item is about self-perception, not actual behavior, and people in constrained segments often still report moderate self-efficacy. Therefore, I retain the V4 baseline for identity (SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9%), with no further downward adjustment, as the evidence does not strongly indicate lower self-perceived money management than the already-lowered V4 baseline. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative anchors and well-calibrated V4 baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=22.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=15.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. V4 baseline for this is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10% (57% agreement), but for this segment ('Hard-up Households'), we must calibrate downward due to financial constraint signals. Quantitative evidence shows only 17.8% manage savings online (suggesting lower financial engagement/confidence), and high spending on miscellaneous goods/services (30.3%) may indicate less structured budgeting. The car ownership rate is moderate (72%), but this does not directly indicate financial management skill. Given these, agreement should be slightly below the V4 baseline: SA 22% (unchanged), A 32% (-3pp), N 22% (+4pp), D 15% (baseline), SD 9% (baseline). This reflects a modest reduction in agreement and a small increase in neutrality, consistent with the segment's likely lower financial confidence. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative signals and well-calibrated V4 baseline.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the relevant quantitative evidence (notably the low agreement with 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' at 17%) to support the use of the low baseline for agreement with the insurance concept. The segment's financial constraints are appropriately considered as a reason not to uplift the estimate. The repeated application of the well-calibrated V4 baseline is methodologically sound, given the lack of contradictory evidence and the alignment with segment characteristics. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything' (attitude). For this segment (Hard-up Households), the closest quantitative anchor is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' at 0.17, which is low and suggests a practical, cost-conscious mindset. The V4 baseline for 'well insured for everything' is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement), which is already calibrated for low agreement and matches the general population. There is no evidence to suggest this segment would be higher than baseline; if anything, financial constraints may make comprehensive insurance less of a priority. No demographic uplift is warranted. The prediction is therefore the V4 baseline for this concept, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment and lack of contradictory qualitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('It is important to be well insured for everything'), and the V4 baseline for this specific item is well-calibrated at: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence from this segment ('Hard-up Households') shows low agreement with other 'responsibility' or 'future planning' attitudes (e.g., only 17% agree that fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car), suggesting a low tendency to prioritize long-term or protective financial behaviors. There is no evidence of higher-than-baseline agreement, and the segment's economic constraints likely further reduce agreement with the importance of comprehensive insurance. Therefore, the general template is applied without upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment characteristics and the baseline calibration.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this item is well-calibrated and should use the baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative topline for a similar 'fuel consumption' attitude is 0.17 (17%), which is low and supports a low agreement estimate. The segment 'Hard-up Households' is likely to deprioritize comprehensive insurance due to financial constraints, further supporting a low agreement. No evidence suggests a need for upward demographic calibration. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class calibration.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything', which is an attitude item. According to the V4 prompt, this specific concept is among those that are well-calibrated and should keep the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence for this segment ('hard-up households') shows low agreement with other 'responsibility' or 'future planning' attitudes (e.g., only 17% agree fuel consumption is most important when buying a car), suggesting a low tendency to prioritize long-term or protective features. This supports the use of the lower baseline. No demographic calibration is needed, as the baseline already reflects low agreement and the segment is not flagged for a specific adjustment. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative alignment and the concept being well-calibrated in V3/V4.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated (no systematic error in V3), so the baseline is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The segment 'Hard-up Households' is a lower-income, financially constrained group, as indicated by the file name and supporting evidence (low agreement with 'fuel consumption is most important when buying a car' at 17%). There is no evidence to suggest higher agreement with insurance importance; if anything, financial constraint may reduce agreement due to affordability barriers. No demographic calibration is needed (V4: only +4pp for lowest income, but not applied unless evidence supports). Therefore, the well-calibrated baseline is used. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and strong cross-class calibration for this item.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes in 'hard-up households' is sufficiently justified. The topline quantitative evidence shows very low prevalence of vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.4%) diets, with a high proportion eating meat (81%), indicating that restrictive or health-motivated eating behaviors are uncommon in this segment. The rationale for applying the V4 correction (due to systematic over-prediction in previous versions) is clearly explained and consistently applied across all runs. The lack of strong qualitative evidence for higher health orientation further supports not adjusting the baseline upward. The distribution aligns with the corrected V4 template and is well-supported by the evidence provided. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 26.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is now 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative data shows only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 14% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 81% eating meat. This suggests low prevalence of restrictive healthy eating behaviors, which aligns with the lower baseline. No evidence suggests this segment is more health-oriented than average, so no upward demographic calibration is warranted. The distribution follows the V4 corrected template for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and high V4 cross-class consistency for this correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is set at 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 14% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 81% eating meat—indicating low prevalence of restrictive or health-motivated diets. This supports the lower baseline. No strong qualitative evidence is present to suggest higher agreement. Demographic calibration is not applied here as the evidence is already segment-specific. The distribution maintains variance and aligns with the V4 correction for 'Healthy Eating'.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude), and for V4, this requires a major correction due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3). The corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14% (38% agreement). The quantitative evidence shows very low rates of vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) diets, with 81% eating meat and 14% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while healthy eating as a value may be present, actual dietary change is low, supporting the need for a lower agreement estimate. No strong qualitative evidence is present to override this. Demographic calibration is not applied further, as the V4 correction already accounts for systematic bias in all classes. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude), and V4 mandates a major correction (-22pp) due to systematic over-prediction in all classes. The quantitative evidence shows very low rates of vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.4%) diets, and a high prevalence of meat-eating (81%) in 'Hard-up Households.' This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with health-focused behaviors. The V4 cross-class correction for 'Healthy Eating' is appropriate here, as the evidence does not support a higher agreement rate. The distribution is thus set at the V4 corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' (SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%), reflecting both the attitudinal nature and the segment's actual eating habits. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and the systematic V4 correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a -22pp correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction in all classes. The quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 14% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 81% eating meat. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with health-focused behaviors, especially in 'hard-up households.' The V4 corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14% (38% agreement), which fits the evidence and maintains the required variance. No demographic calibration is applied as the evidence already reflects the segment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and the use of the V4 cross-class correction.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 baseline for the attitude statement, which is appropriate given the evidence. The quantitative toplines (e.g., low plans to use other investments for retirement, moderate saving for a purpose, moderate trust in comparison sites) do not directly contradict the attitude of personal responsibility for retirement; rather, they reflect means and opportunity, not belief. The qualitative notes and demographic context are considered, and the V4 baseline is already calibrated for lower-income groups. There is no strong evidence suggesting a need for further adjustment. The justification is clear, methodologically sound, and confidence is appropriately high.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.00%
  Slightly disagree: 13.00%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is used: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment (hard-up households) shows low use of other investments for retirement (11%), moderate agreement with saving for specific purposes (37%), and moderate trust in price comparison sites (52%). There is no direct evidence contradicting the baseline, and the segment is not flagged for a strong demographic adjustment. The V4 template for this concept is already calibrated for lower-income/financially constrained groups, so no further downward adjustment is needed. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of conflicting evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'). V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3 due to mild over-prediction (+3pp). The quantitative evidence from this segment (hard-up households) shows low intent to use other investments for retirement (0.11), but this does not directly contradict the attitude of personal responsibility—it may reflect lack of means rather than lack of belief. Other attitudes (saving for a purpose: 0.37; switching utilities: 0.32) suggest moderate engagement with financial planning, but not high. No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the V4 baseline for this concept. Demographic calibration is not applied here, as the correction is already moderate and the evidence does not indicate a strong deviation. Confidence is high due to direct mapping of concept to V4 template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The item is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is applied: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows low intent to use other investments for retirement (11%), but this does not directly contradict the attitude of personal responsibility—it may reflect means, not beliefs. Other financial attitudes (saving for a purpose, trust in comparison sites, switching utilities) are moderate to low, but none directly address the responsibility belief. No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the V4 baseline for this concept. Demographic calibration is not applied here, as the V4 correction for this concept is already conservative and context does not indicate a strong deviation. Confidence is high due to direct concept match and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but closely aligns with the 'retirement is your responsibility' item, which is treated as an identity/attitude hybrid in V4. The V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement), after correcting for V3's over-prediction. Quantitative evidence from this segment shows low use of other investments for retirement (11%), moderate agreement with saving for a specific purpose (37%), and moderate trust in financial tools (52%). These do not suggest a strong deviation from the V4 baseline. No strong qualitative evidence suggests a lower sense of personal responsibility than the general population. Demographic calibration for 'hard-up households' would, if anything, slightly reduce agreement, but V4's demographic adjustments are now minimal (max -2pp), so the baseline is retained. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with V4's cross-class correction and the absence of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'). V4 baseline for this concept is 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 18% neither, 13% slightly disagree, 9% strongly disagree (60% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3 due to prior over-prediction. The quantitative evidence from this segment ('Plans to use other investments for retirement' at 11%) suggests low proactive retirement planning, but this does not directly contradict the attitude of personal responsibility—it may reflect low means or opportunity rather than belief. Other financial attitudes (saving for a purpose: 37%, switching utilities worth effort: 32%) indicate moderate engagement with financial planning, but not high. No evidence suggests a need to further lower the baseline for this segment. Demographic calibration is not applied here, as 'hard-up households' do not show a strong, consistent deviation for this concept in V4. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with V4's cross-class correction and the lack of contradictory quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is sufficiently justified. The topline percentages are consistently applied across all runs, with clear rationale referencing the V4 baseline and its calibration history. The quantitative evidence (high outgoings on utilities and council tax) is appropriately considered as a potential motivator, but the lack of evidence for high switching activity or strong positive attitudes is correctly used to avoid upward adjustment. The qualitative context is minimal but acknowledged. The rationale for not applying further demographic calibration is sound, given the conservative and well-calibrated baseline. The slight nudge toward more disagreement in Run 5 is methodologically reasonable and transparently explained. Overall, the estimate is well-grounded in the provided evidence and the evidence hierarchy is respected.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude item. V4 baseline for 'Switching utilities worth effort' is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement), and this concept is well-calibrated (V3 error -2.1pp, so no adjustment needed). Quantitative evidence shows this segment ('Hard-up Households') spends a moderate amount on utilities and housing, but there is no evidence of unusually high engagement with switching or strong attitudes toward effortful financial behaviors. No demographic calibration is needed, as the baseline is already conservative and fits the evidence. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative support and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude item. V4 baseline for 'Switching utilities worth effort' is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement), and this concept is well-calibrated (V3 error -2.1pp), so no further correction is needed. Demographic calibration for 'Hard-up Households' (low income, likely older, financially constrained) would suggest slightly lower agreement, but V4 reduces demographic adjustments by 50%, so the baseline is appropriate. Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities and council tax, but no evidence of high switching activity or strong positive attitudes toward switching. Qualitative context is minimal. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied with high confidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 baseline for this type is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. This matches the well-calibrated template for this concept from V3, which V4 keeps unchanged due to minimal error in prior rounds. The segment ('Hard-up Households') shows high outgoings on utilities and housing, but there is no direct evidence of high switching rates or strong positive attitudes toward switching. The quantitative data (high utility costs) could suggest some motivation to switch, but for this segment, friction and perceived effort are likely high, so agreement is not expected to be above baseline. No demographic calibration is applied, as the V4 template is already well-calibrated for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and cross-class calibration.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to the V4 baseline for this concept (well-calibrated, no systematic error), the default is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement). The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related bills, which could suggest some motivation to switch, but the segment 'Hard-up Households' likely faces barriers (e.g., low digital access, inertia, or perceived hassle). The sporting event and place of worship visitation rates are low, indicating limited discretionary activity, which may correlate with lower engagement in proactive behaviors like switching suppliers. No evidence suggests a higher or lower agreement than the baseline, so the V4 template is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the well-calibrated nature of this concept in V4.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 attitude baseline applies: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. For 'hard-up households', there is no strong evidence of higher or lower agreement than the general population. Quantitative data shows high outgoings on utilities (2438.36), which could suggest some motivation to switch, but the friction and effort required may be a barrier for this segment. No direct evidence of high switching rates or strong positive attitudes is present. Therefore, I keep the V4 baseline for attitudes, with a slight nudge toward more disagreement (D +5pp, N +2pp, A -5pp, SA -2pp) to reflect likely inertia and resource constraints in this segment. This maintains the overall variance and is consistent with the well-calibrated V4 template for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I like to use cash when making purchases' among Hard-Up Households is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references strong quantitative evidence (low online purchase rates for everyday items) and aligns with the qualitative profile (lower digital engagement, possible cash reliance). Adjustments to the V4 baseline are modest and well-calibrated, reflecting the evidence without over-extrapolation. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the demographic calibration is applied appropriately. No major methodological gaps are present, and confidence is high due to the clear alignment between evidence and prediction.

Run 1: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude'. V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement). For Hard-Up Households, quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcohol 19%, pet care 23%), indicating a likely preference for cash or in-person transactions. Home appliances and travel are higher (53%, 49%), but these are less frequent purchases and may not reflect everyday payment preferences. Qualitative profile suggests lower digital engagement and possible cash reliance. Therefore, I slightly increase agreement (+2pp to SA/A) over the V4 baseline for this segment, reflecting a modest but not dramatic cash preference. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude'. V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement). For 'Hard-Up Households', qualitative and quantitative evidence suggest a slightly higher preference for cash than the general population, due to lower digital access and financial constraints. However, online purchase rates for low-friction categories (alcoholic drinks 19%, pet care 23%) are low, supporting a modest upward adjustment. Therefore, I increase SA/A by +1pp each (to 15%/25%), and slightly reduce D/SD. This maintains V4's lower baseline while reflecting segment-specific cash preference. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors and clear demographic profile.
Run 3: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude'. V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is 13/24/28/22/13 (37% agreement), but for Hard-Up Households, cash preference is likely slightly higher due to lower digital access and financial exclusion. However, online purchase rates for this segment are low (19% for alcohol, 23% for pet care, ~50% for appliances/travel), supporting a modest upward calibration. Demographic calibration for low income is +4pp, but V4 reduces this by 50% (so +2pp). Therefore, I slightly increase 'agree' categories by 2pp (to 15/26), and reduce 'disagree' accordingly. This maintains the V4 correction for over-prediction, while reflecting the segment's likely higher cash preference. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear demographic fit.
Run 4: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude'. V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is 13/24/28/22/13 (37% agreement). For Hard-Up Households, quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcohol 19%, pet care 23%), indicating a likely higher preference for cash. Home appliances and travel are higher (53%, 49%), but these are less frequent purchases and may be exceptions due to necessity. Demographic calibration for low income is +4pp, but V4 reduces this by 50% (so +2pp). Therefore, I increase 'strongly agree' and 'slightly agree' by 2pp total (to 15/25), and reduce 'slightly disagree' and 'strongly disagree' accordingly. This maintains the V4 correction for over-prediction, but acknowledges the segment's likely higher cash preference. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear demographic fit.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement). Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 19%, pet care 23%), suggesting a higher preference for cash and in-person transactions among Hard-Up Households. However, the concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is only -3pp from V3, and the demographic calibration for low income is +4pp, but V4 reduces this by 50% (so +2pp). The evidence hierarchy prioritizes the direct quantitative data, which supports the baseline or slightly higher cash preference, but not dramatically so. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, with a slight upward nudge justified by the segment's low online engagement, but this is already reflected in the V4 template for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
