### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.66
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale for each run correctly identifies that the quantitative data provided (low rates of managing/arranging accounts by phone, country of birth) are not direct proxies for the attitude concept being measured. The use of a conservative baseline attitude template is appropriate in the absence of direct attitudinal or strong qualitative evidence. The repeated application of the baseline, with moderate confidence due to lack of direct evidence, is methodologically sound. No major revision is needed unless new, more directly relevant evidence becomes available.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the revised attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%) is applied. There is no direct quantitative evidence about agreement with the 'Concept' itself, only about behaviors (e.g., managing/arranging accounts by phone) and country of birth, all with very low values (1-10%). However, these are not direct attitude proxies, so they do not justify a major deviation from the baseline. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the conservative attitude template is used without further adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative baseline template is used (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided is not directly about the target concept, but rather about behaviors (e.g., managing accounts by phone) and demographics (country of birth), all with very low values (1-10%). However, since these are not directly related to the attitude concept in question, they do not warrant a major adjustment from the baseline. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the baseline attitude template is applied with no further downward correction. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative baseline template is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account by phone' at 10%, 'Arrange current account by phone' at 2%) is not directly related to the attitude concept, but does indicate low engagement with certain behaviors, suggesting a generally low tendency toward strong agreement on attitudinal items. No direct quantitative evidence overrides the baseline, and qualitative evidence is minimal. No demographic calibration is warranted as the evidence is not concept-specific. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative baseline template is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows extremely low rates for related behaviors (e.g., managing/arranging accounts by phone: 1-10%), but these are behavioral, not attitudinal, and do not directly map to the attitude in question. There is no direct quantitative evidence for the attitude itself, and qualitative notes are absent. No demographic calibration is warranted as the evidence is not concept-specific. Therefore, the baseline attitude template is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative attitude baseline is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about the target concept, and the only quantitative data provided relates to behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging accounts by phone) and country of birth, all with very low prevalence (1-10%). These do not directly inform the attitude distribution for a generic 'Concept' item. No qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the baseline is applied with no demographic or concept-specific adjustments. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The predicted distribution for agreement with 'I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events' is strongly grounded in the direct quantitative evidence provided: only 7% of 'Stable Seniors' consider themselves environmentalists, and only 23% think energy companies do not care about the environment. These are highly relevant proxies for environmental concern and are far below the generic attitude baseline. The rationale for pushing agreement rates well below the baseline and increasing disagreement is clearly articulated and consistently applied across all runs. The evidence hierarchy is respected, with direct quantitative data weighted most heavily. The qualitative evidence is not over-relied upon, and the prediction avoids overestimating agreement. Confidence is high due to the direct match between the evidence and the predicted distribution. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.40%
  Slightly agree: 10.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 26.40%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=10.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=27.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability among 'Stable Seniors' (ACORN segment). The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low: only 7% consider themselves environmentalists, and just 23% think energy companies do not care about the environment. These are both direct and highly relevant proxies for environmental concern and skepticism. There is no evidence of strong pro-environmental attitudes in this segment. According to the evidence hierarchy, these quantitative data override any generic attitude template. Therefore, agreement should be very low, with a large majority either neutral or disagreeing. The distribution is pushed lower than the attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%) to reflect the direct evidence, resulting in only 13% agreement and 59% disagreement. Confidence is high due to the direct quantitative match.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=10.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=27.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', but direct quantitative evidence from the segment (stable seniors) shows extremely low agreement with environmentalist attitudes: only 7% consider themselves environmentalists (file=ACORN_stable_seniors.csv, relevance=0.98), and only 23% think energy companies do not care about the environment (relevance=0.94). There is no evidence of strong pro-environmental sentiment. According to the evidence hierarchy, direct quantitative data is weighted most heavily (80%). The baseline for attitude is already low (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%), but given the very low agreement in the data, the distribution is pushed even lower, with only 3% strongly agree and 10% slightly agree. The majority are expected to be neutral or disagreeing, with a significant portion (32% SD, 27% D) disagreeing. This matches the evidence and applies the guardrail to avoid over-prediction. Confidence is high due to strong direct quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=10.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=27.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability among 'Stable Seniors' (ACORN segment). The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low: only 7% consider themselves environmentalists, and just 23% think energy companies do not care about the environment. These are both direct and highly relevant proxies for environmental concern, and both are far below the attitude baseline. There is no evidence of strong pro-environmental sentiment in this group. According to the system's evidence hierarchy, direct quantitative evidence (7% and 23%) should dominate, and the prediction should be much lower than the attitude template (which would be SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%). Given the 7% environmentalist figure, I push the 'strongly agree' to the floor (3%), and 'slightly agree' to 10%. The majority are likely to be neutral or disagree, so I increase 'slightly disagree' and 'strongly disagree' accordingly. This matches the system's guidance to push predictions lower when quantitative evidence is low, and to increase variance. Confidence is high due to the direct, highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=10.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=26.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: This is an attitude item, so the baseline would be SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, direct quantitative evidence shows only 7% of this segment consider themselves environmentalists (very low), and only 23% think energy companies do not care about the environment (low skepticism). There is no evidence of strong environmental concern in this group. Following the evidence hierarchy, the direct quantitative data (7% environmentalist) is weighted most heavily, so agreement must be much lower than the attitude baseline. The prediction is further reduced to reflect the segment's likely apathy or skepticism toward environmental sustainability at events. Variance is increased to reflect the strong evidence of low agreement, pushing agreement even lower and disagreement higher. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=11.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability, asked of 'stable seniors' (older, less progressive, lower digital engagement). The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low: only 7% consider themselves environmentalists, and just 23% think energy companies don't care about the environment. Both indicate low salience of environmental issues in this segment. No direct evidence for event-specific sustainability, but the general environmental concern is very low. According to the system prompt, direct quantitative evidence (7%) should be weighted at 80%, so agreement must be very low. The attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%) is too high for this segment and concept. Applying the evidence hierarchy, I push agreement even lower than the baseline, with a high proportion disagreeing or neutral. Increased variance is applied to avoid clustering around the mean. Confidence is high due to strong, direct quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.92
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently applies the V2 concept-specific correction, which is appropriate for this high-friction but high-agreement item. The high outgoings on housing/utilities (68.88%) for the 'Stable Seniors' segment supports the inference that cost-consciousness is salient, even though there is no direct quantitative measure for this specific attitude. The lack of contradictory evidence and the demographic fit (elderly, likely on fixed incomes) further reinforce the plausibility of the estimate. The confidence is high, though not maximal, due to the absence of direct quantitative data for the exact item, but the use of the concept-specific correction is methodologically sound in this context.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 8.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-friction behavior but, per V2 guidance, is an exception where agreement is higher than baseline (under-predicted by 21pp in V1). The segment is 'Stable Seniors' (elderly, likely cost-conscious). Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on housing/utilities (68.88%), suggesting this is a salient issue. No direct quantitative match for the specific attitude, but the concept-specific correction for this item is to use: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Demographic calibration (elderly, cost-conscious) would support, not reduce, this higher agreement. No evidence contradicts this, and qualitative notes are not available. Confidence is high due to strong concept-specific correction and supporting quantitative context.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-friction behavior but, per V2 guidance, is an exception where actual agreement is higher than baseline. The segment is 'Stable Seniors' (elderly), who typically have high outgoings on utilities (68.88%) and are cost-conscious. There is no direct quantitative data for this exact item, but the concept-specific correction for this item is to increase agreement by 21pp over baseline, resulting in SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Demographic calibration for elderly (normally +8pp for healthcare, not directly relevant here) is not applied further, as the concept-specific correction already accounts for higher agreement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence of high utility spending and the concept-specific correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-friction behavior but, per V2 guidance, is an exception where agreement is under-predicted and should be increased by 21pp. The segment is 'Stable Seniors', with high outgoings on housing/utilities (68.88%), but very low digital engagement (chatbots 23%, computers confuse me 15%), and low support for local businesses (15%). However, the concept-specific correction for this item is to use: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. There is no direct quantitative evidence for this exact item in this segment, so the concept-specific correction dominates. Demographic calibration for elderly (+8pp for healthcare, not directly relevant here) is not applied. The rationale is weighted 80% on the concept-specific correction, 20% on the high utility outgoings (which may slightly reinforce the likelihood of cost-consciousness). Confidence is high due to strong concept-specific evidence and lack of conflicting quantitative data.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-friction behavior but, per V2 guidance, is an exception where actual agreement is higher than baseline. The segment is 'Stable Seniors', with high outgoings on housing/utilities (68.9%), but very low digital engagement (chatbots 23%, computers confuse me 15%), and low support for local businesses (15%). However, the concept-specific correction for this item is to INCREASE agreement by 21pp over baseline, reflecting cost-consciousness among older, stable demographics. There is no direct quantitative match for this exact item, but the high outgoings on utilities and the demographic's likely fixed income support the idea that many will make an effort to cut down on energy use. Therefore, I apply the concept-specific template: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to strong concept-specific correction and demographic fit, though not maximal due to lack of direct quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-salience cost-conscious behavior. The segment is 'Stable Seniors' (from ACORN), with high outgoings on housing/utilities (68.88%), but very low digital engagement (chatbots 23%, computers confuse me 15%). There is no direct quantitative for energy-saving effort, but the segment's high utility spend and likely fixed income suggest a strong incentive to economize. The V2 template for this concept (per system prompt) is: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. No evidence contradicts this, and the demographic (elderly, cost-conscious) supports the higher agreement. Confidence is high due to strong template match and segment fit, but not maximal due to lack of direct quantitative. No over-prediction correction needed as this concept was under-predicted in V1.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.87
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence ('environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions important when buying a car' at 35%) and correctly notes that this is a broader/softer criterion than the stricter 'fuel consumption is the most important feature.' The application of the concept-specific correction (reduce by 30pp) is appropriate and aligns with the system prompt. The low agreement on related attitudinal items (insurance, online research, environmental concern) further supports a conservative estimate. No qualitative evidence contradicts the quantitative findings. The repeated use of the template (SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%) is justified by the evidence hierarchy and explicit system guidance. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and methodological transparency. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 5.00%
  Slightly agree: 15.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 30.00%
  Strongly disagree: 22.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item, but the evidence shows low agreement with related environmental priorities among 'stable seniors' (35% for environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions as important when buying a car, 23% think energy companies don't care about the environment). The segment also shows low agreement with being well insured (12%) and low online research (18%), indicating low engagement with high-effort or value-driven behaviors. The concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' is to reduce by 30pp due to systematic over-prediction. Therefore, I use the corrected template: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. This matches the quantitative evidence and applies the conservative baseline. Confidence is high due to strong direct quantitative proxies.
Run 2: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', but the V2 prompt specifies a concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' due to systematic over-prediction (+30pp bias). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the 35% agreement for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions important when buying a car' (relevance=0.98), which is a closely related but slightly broader/softer criterion than 'fuel consumption is the most important feature'. This suggests actual agreement for the stricter 'most important' wording will be lower. Other evidence (energy companies/environment, insurance, online research) is less directly relevant and all show low agreement (12-23%). The segment is 'stable seniors', who may care about cost but are less likely to prioritize fuel consumption above all else. The V2 template for this concept is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. No demographic lift is warranted (seniors are not especially eco- or fuel-focused). The evidence hierarchy strongly supports a conservative estimate, and the template matches the best available data. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude, but the evidence shows low prioritization of environmental and fuel-related features among 'stable seniors.' The most relevant quantitative topline is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 35%, which is the highest agreement in the set, but still low for a positive attitude. The segment also scores low on 'energy companies do not care about the environment' (23%) and 'well insured for everything' (12%), indicating a generally low tendency to strongly agree with attitudinal statements. The concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' is to REDUCE by 30pp, using the template: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. No demographic lift is warranted (seniors are not especially fuel-focused), and no qualitative evidence contradicts this. The prediction is therefore anchored to the concept-specific correction, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: 1. Concept type: This is an attitude item, but the specific concept ('fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is closely related to the provided quantitative evidence for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' (35%) and is subject to the concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' (reduce by 30pp). 2. Quantitative evidence: The closest direct evidence is 35% agreement for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' as important when buying a car among stable seniors. This is a slightly broader/softer concept than 'fuel consumption is the most important feature', which is more restrictive. 3. Template: The system prompt specifies for this concept to use: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. 4. Demographic calibration: Stable seniors are likely to be somewhat less focused on fuel economy as the single most important feature, so no upward adjustment is warranted. 5. No qualitative evidence is available to override the quantitative. 6. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative match and explicit system guidance for this concept.
Run 5: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude (fuel consumption as most important when buying a car). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the 35% agreement for 'environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions important when buying a car' (relevance=0.98), which is a closely related but not identical concept. This suggests that only a minority of this segment (Stable Seniors) prioritize environmental/fuel factors. The baseline for this concept (per v2 instructions) is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. No direct evidence suggests higher agreement, and the segment's low scores on related environmental attitudes (23% agree energy companies don't care about the environment) and insurance (12% agree well insured for everything) reinforce a conservative estimate. No qualitative evidence is available to override this. The prediction is therefore anchored to the concept-specific correction template, with high confidence due to strong quantitative evidence.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently applies a concept-specific correction template due to systematic over-prediction in previous versions, and this is appropriate given the lack of direct quantitative evidence on debt aversion for the 'Stable Seniors' segment. The use of quantitative proxies (low risk appetite, low mobility, low community engagement) is methodologically sound, as these all point to a cautious, conservative profile, supporting the moderate agreement levels predicted. The decision not to apply further demographic calibration is justified by the absence of evidence indicating higher debt aversion among older segments. The confidence is appropriately high, and the justification is clear and well-grounded in the evidence provided. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The segment is 'Stable Seniors' (older, likely risk-averse, financially conservative). Quantitative evidence shows low agreement with risk-taking (18.5% agree), low community engagement (8.8%), and low concern for climate change (22.4%). These all indicate a generally conservative, cautious profile, but not strongly activist or high in agreement on attitudinal items. The concept-specific correction for this item is to use: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (down from the original over-predicted 68% agreement). No direct quantitative evidence on debt aversion is present, so the concept-specific template is applied without further upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and clear segment profile.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. For this, the V2 template for this specific concept (based on systematic over-prediction in V1) is: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence for this segment (Stable Seniors) shows low agreement with risk-taking (18.5%), low community engagement (9%), and low concern for climate change (22%), all suggesting a generally cautious and conservative profile, but not extremely so. There is no direct quantitative evidence for debt aversion, so the concept-specific correction is applied without further upward or downward adjustment. Demographic calibration is not applied further, as the evidence does not indicate a need to deviate from the corrected template. Confidence is high due to the use of a concept-specific correction and supporting quantitative evidence indicating a cautious attitude.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. For this, the V2 template for this specific concept is: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (see concept-specific corrections). The segment is 'Stable Seniors', for which there is no direct quantitative data on debt aversion, but the available evidence (low risk appetite: 19% agree, low likelihood to move: 25%, low community engagement: 9%, low climate threat concern: 22%) all suggest a conservative, risk-averse, and stability-oriented group. This supports the use of the concept-specific correction template without upward adjustment. No evidence suggests higher agreement than the template. Confidence is high due to the strong match between the segment's characteristics and the template, and the lack of conflicting quantitative data.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The segment is 'Stable Seniors' (older, likely retired, risk-averse, low mobility). Quantitative evidence shows low risk appetite (18.5% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money'), low community engagement (8.8%), and low agreement with climate change as a threat (22.4%). There is no direct quantitative evidence for debt aversion, but the low risk tolerance and likely conservative financial attitudes suggest moderate agreement. However, the concept-specific correction for this item is to reduce agreement by 26pp from previous over-prediction, so the template is: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. No demographic lift is applied, as older segments are not specifically more debt-averse in the evidence. The prediction is conservative, with moderate agreement and a significant minority neutral or disagreeing. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and clear template guidance.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude item. For this concept, the V2 guidance specifies a reduced baseline due to systematic over-prediction (+26pp previously). The template for this concept is: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence from the segment (Stable Seniors) shows low agreement with risk-taking (18.5% agree), low community engagement (9%), and low concern for climate change (22%), all suggesting a generally cautious and conservative profile, but not strongly polarized. There is no direct quantitative evidence for debt aversion, so the concept-specific correction is applied without further upward adjustment. Demographic calibration is not applied further, as the evidence does not indicate a need to deviate from the template. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the concept-specific correction and supporting quantitative evidence.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.74
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I am very good at managing money' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently applies a conservative attitude baseline due to the lack of direct self-assessment data for financial skill among 'stable seniors.' The only moderately relevant quantitative proxy (25% manage savings accounts online) is appropriately interpreted as indicating moderate digital/financial engagement, not high confidence. The segment's characteristics (stable, older, cautious) are reasonably used to avoid upward or downward calibration. The lack of qualitative evidence is acknowledged, and the topline is not over-interpreted. The repeated runs show internal consistency and careful consideration of the evidence. No major corrective feedback is needed; the justification is methodologically sound given the constraints.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 9.60%
  Slightly agree: 24.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.80%
  Slightly disagree: 20.80%
  Strongly disagree: 14.60%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I am very good at managing money'), so the attitude baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence is limited: only 25% manage savings online (suggesting low digital engagement), but this does not directly indicate money management confidence. The segment ('stable seniors') likely includes people with fixed incomes and routine spending, but no evidence suggests high self-assessed financial skill. No direct quantitative data on self-perceived money management skill is available, so the conservative baseline is retained. No demographic calibration is applied, as 'stable seniors' do not strongly deviate from the general population on this attitude. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=9.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: 1) Concept type: This is an 'attitude' item, so the conservative baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. 2) Quantitative evidence: Only 25% manage savings accounts online (suggesting moderate digital/financial confidence), and only 5% are very worried about car theft (suggesting low anxiety, but not directly relevant). The high rate of privately owned cars (85%) may indicate some financial stability, but not necessarily skill. No direct evidence of high financial self-efficacy. 3) Demographic calibration: 'Stable Seniors' are likely to be cautious and modest in self-assessment, so no upward adjustment. 4) No qualitative evidence provided. 5) Given the lack of strong evidence for high agreement, I slightly lower agreement from baseline and increase 'neither' and 'disagree' to reflect likely modesty and average confidence. Confidence is moderate-high due to relevant quantitative proxies.
Run 3: Strongly agree=9.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.74 / Rationale: This is an attitude item for the 'Stable Seniors' segment. Quantitative evidence is limited: only 25% manage savings accounts online (suggesting moderate financial engagement), and outgoings on miscellaneous goods are not especially high or low. There is no direct evidence of high financial confidence or skill. The segment is older, likely cautious, but not especially digitally active. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the lack of strong positive evidence and the segment's moderate digital engagement, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No evidence suggests strong financial mismanagement, but neither is there evidence of high confidence. The low 'very worried about car theft' (5%) suggests a generally low-anxiety, stable group, but this does not directly translate to financial self-confidence. No demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: This is an attitude item. The conservative attitude baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows only 25% manage savings accounts online (suggesting moderate digital/financial engagement), and the segment is 'stable seniors' (likely to be cautious but not overconfident about money management). No direct evidence of high self-assessed financial competence, and no qualitative evidence to suggest strong agreement. No demographic calibration is warranted (elderly, but not a healthcare or tech concept). Therefore, the baseline template is applied with no upward adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct self-assessment data.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an attitude item. The baseline for attitudes is: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows that only 25% manage savings accounts online (suggesting moderate digital/financial confidence), and the segment is 'stable seniors' (likely to be cautious, not overconfident). There is no direct evidence of high financial self-efficacy, and the segment's high private car ownership and low worry about theft suggest stability but not necessarily high financial skill. No evidence suggests strong over- or under-confidence, so the conservative attitude baseline is appropriate. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct self-assessment data.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the most relevant quantitative evidence ('fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' at 14%) as a proxy for practical, high-friction attitudes, which is appropriate given the lack of direct insurance data. The repeated use of the high-friction template with a further reduction is explicitly supported by prior over-prediction evidence (+40pp), and the decision not to apply demographic or qualitative lifts is justified by the strength and relevance of the quantitative anchor. The confidence is high due to the directness of the evidence and the explicit system guidance. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything', which is a high friction behavior/attitude (requires action, cost, and planning). The most relevant quantitative evidence is for a similar attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), which is very low at 14%. This suggests that this segment (Stable Seniors) does not prioritize practical or cost-related features highly. The concept-specific correction for 'well insured for everything' is to use the high friction template with a further reduction, as prior data showed +40pp over-prediction. Therefore, the distribution is set to SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. No demographic lift is applied, as the quantitative evidence is strong and overrides any qualitative or demographic assumptions. Confidence is high due to the direct quantitative proxy and strong concept-specific correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: 1. Concept type: This is an attitude item, but per system prompt, the 'well insured for everything' concept is known to be systematically over-predicted and should use the HIGH FRICTION BEHAVIOR template with a further reduction (SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%).
2. Quantitative evidence: No direct insurance data for this segment, but the provided evidence shows low prioritization of practical/functional features (e.g., only 14% say fuel consumption is most important when buying a car, and only 22% look out for cinema adverts). This supports a low agreement estimate.
3. Demographic calibration: The segment is 'stable seniors' (likely older, possibly more risk-averse), but the system prompt says to be conservative with demographic lifts. No strong evidence to override the concept-specific correction.
4. Variance: The prediction is intentionally low and spread, matching the system's guidance to avoid over-prediction and increase variance.
5. Confidence: High, as the concept-specific correction is directly specified in the prompt and supported by low agreement on other practical attitudes in the segment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything', which is a high friction behavior/attitude (requires effort, cost, and is often aspirational rather than enacted). The most relevant quantitative evidence is for a similar attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') with only 14% agreement among stable seniors, indicating a strong tendency to deprioritize practical, cost-related features. This supports a low agreement prediction. The concept-specific correction for 'well insured for everything' is to use the high friction template and reduce agreement further (SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%), as prior data showed a +40pp over-prediction bias. No qualitative evidence is available to contradict this. Demographic calibration is not applied as the quantitative evidence is strong and overrides. Confidence is high due to the direct, highly relevant quantitative evidence and the established correction template.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything', which is a high-friction behavior/attitude (requires action, cost, and planning). The direct quantitative evidence for a similar high-friction, practical attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is very low (14%), indicating this segment (Stable Seniors) does not prioritize practical, cost-conscious, or risk-averse features highly. There is no direct evidence for insurance, but the provided concept-specific correction for 'well insured for everything' is to use a much lower baseline (SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%) due to systematic over-prediction in previous rounds. No demographic calibration is needed, as Stable Seniors are not especially high or low on insurance attitudes based on the evidence. No qualitative evidence is available to override the quantitative. Confidence is high due to the strong, relevant quantitative anchor and the explicit concept-specific correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything', which is a high friction behavior/attitude (requires action, cost, and planning). The most relevant quantitative evidence is for a similar 'practical' attitude: only 14% of this segment (Stable Seniors) say fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car, indicating a low prioritization of practical/cost-saving features. Other evidence (adverts, mass market) also shows low engagement with proactive or protective behaviors. According to the V2 prompt, this concept is known to be systematically over-predicted (+40pp), so the high friction behavior template with a further reduction is used: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. No qualitative evidence is available to contradict this. Confidence is high due to strong direct quantitative evidence and a clear concept-specific correction.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.87
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes among Stable Seniors is well justified based on the provided evidence. The topline quantitative data shows very low rates of vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.1%) diets, with a large majority (76%) eating meat and a moderate minority (18%) in pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This strongly supports the rationale that strong agreement with 'Healthy Eating' as an attitude is not widespread in this segment. The predicted distribution appropriately lowers agreement and raises neutrality/disagreement compared to a generic attitude baseline. The rationales consistently reference the quantitative evidence and explain the adjustments made. Confidence is high due to the direct and relevant quantitative data. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 21.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 32.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.40%
  Strongly disagree: 16.40%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=24.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: 1) Concept type: This is an attitude item (Healthy Eating), so the baseline is moderate agreement and spread. 2) Quantitative evidence: The segment (Stable Seniors) has very low vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.1%) rates, and a high rate of eating meat (76%). Pescatarian/flexitarian/other is 18%. This suggests that while a minority may have some alternative eating habits, the overwhelming majority are not strongly motivated by healthy eating as defined by plant-based or restrictive diets. 3) Demographic calibration: Seniors may have some health awareness, but the quantitative data shows little actual dietary change. 4) Evidence hierarchy: The quantitative data (meat-eating 76%) is weighted most heavily, indicating low strong agreement with 'Healthy Eating' as a guiding attitude. 5) Variance: Pushed agreement lower and disagreement higher to reflect the data and avoid over-prediction. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). Direct quantitative evidence shows extremely low vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.1%) rates, with a very high proportion eating meat (76%) and a moderate minority in pescatarian/flexitarian/other (18%). This indicates that while some may value healthy eating, the actual adoption of restrictive or health-focused diets is low among 'Stable Seniors.' Therefore, agreement with 'Healthy Eating' as an attitude is likely to be below the attitude baseline (10% SA, 25% A), with higher neutrality and disagreement. No qualitative evidence suggests a strong health focus. The distribution is shifted downward to reflect the low prevalence of healthy eating behaviors, with increased 'neither' and disagreement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). Quantitative evidence shows extremely low vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.1%) rates, with a large majority (76%) eating meat and 18% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may value healthy eating in principle, actual dietary choices skew heavily toward traditional, less restrictive diets. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the evidence, agreement should be LOWERED: the low rates of plant-based diets indicate that strong agreement with 'Healthy Eating' as a value is not widespread in this segment. I reduced both agree categories by several points and increased neutrality and disagreement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). Quantitative evidence shows extremely low vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.1%) rates, with a large majority (76%) eating meat and 18% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may value healthy eating in principle, actual dietary choices skew traditional and are not strongly health-focused. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the evidence, agreement should be LOWERED: the low prevalence of plant-based diets among 'Stable Seniors' indicates less enthusiasm for health-driven eating. I reduced both 'agree' categories and increased 'neither' and 'disagree' to reflect the quantitative data. Confidence is high due to strong direct quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). Quantitative evidence shows extremely low vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.1%) rates, with a large majority (76%) eating meat and 18% in pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may value healthy eating, it is not a dominant or strongly held attitude in this segment (Stable Seniors). The attitude template baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low prevalence of restrictive diets, I reduce agreement by 5pp and increase neutrality/disagreement. No qualitative evidence suggests strong health focus. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The runs consistently reference the most relevant quantitative evidence: low agreement with 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (13%), moderate agreement with 'I only save for a specific purpose' (30%), and moderate agreement with 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' (32%). These are appropriate proxies for the concept of personal responsibility for retirement security. The rationale for using the attitude baseline and then calibrating slightly downward (or keeping close to baseline) based on the evidence is methodologically sound. The lack of strong qualitative evidence is correctly noted, and demographic calibration is handled conservatively. The topline estimate (SA 13%, A 27%, N 28%, D ~18-19%, SD ~13-14%) is well-supported by the evidence and reasoning provided. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 18.20%
  Strongly disagree: 13.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is an attitude item. For this segment (stable seniors), the most relevant quantitative evidence is from similar retirement/financial attitude items: 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (13% agree), 'I only save for a specific purpose' (30% agree), and 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' (32% agree). These all show relatively low agreement, suggesting a conservative baseline is appropriate. The attitude template (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%) fits, but I slightly increase agreement (by 2pp) due to the segment's likely sense of personal responsibility (common among older, stable demographics), but not by much given the low agreement in the evidence. No strong qualitative evidence is present. The result is a slightly above-baseline prediction for agreement, with high weight on the quantitative evidence and conservative demographic calibration.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement, so the attitude baseline applies: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows only 13% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting low proactive ownership), and only 30% save for a specific purpose (suggesting moderate personal responsibility). These both indicate agreement is not especially high. The segment is 'stable seniors', who may be more likely to expect state or employer support, so no upward demographic calibration is warranted. The evidence supports a slightly higher than baseline 'agree' (27%) and 'strongly agree' (13%), with 'neither' and disagreement close to baseline. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is an attitude item. For the 'stable seniors' segment, the most relevant quantitative evidence is: (1) Only 12.5% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting low proactive responsibility-taking), (2) 30% only save for a specific purpose (indicating a lack of broad financial planning), and (3) 32% agree switching utilities is worth the effort (showing moderate willingness to take action for financial benefit). The attitude baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low evidence for proactive financial responsibility (12.5% planning for retirement), I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Demographic calibration is minimal, as 'stable seniors' are not especially likely to endorse self-responsibility for retirement (they may expect state or employer provision). Therefore, I predict: SA 13%, A 27%, N 28%, D 18%, SD 14%. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The concept 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is an attitude item. For stable seniors, the most relevant quantitative evidence is low agreement with 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (13%), moderate agreement with 'I only save for a specific purpose' (30%), and moderate agreement with 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' (32%). These suggest a relatively low sense of proactive financial self-reliance and low appetite for financial change. The attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%) is appropriate, but given the low direct evidence for self-driven retirement planning, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Demographic calibration is minimal as this segment is not especially high or low on self-reliance. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude item for the 'Stable Seniors' segment. The most relevant quantitative evidence is low agreement with 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (13%), moderate agreement with 'I only save for a specific purpose' (30%), and moderate agreement with 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' (32%). These suggest a cautious, not strongly self-reliant financial attitude. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low 13% for 'other investments for retirement', I slightly reduce the top two categories and increase neutrality/disagreement. There is no evidence of strong self-reliance or high agreement, so I avoid over-prediction. No qualitative evidence suggests a strong sense of personal responsibility. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative proxies.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the concept-specific correction for 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' to the Stable Seniors segment, referencing both the high outgoings on utilities (quantitative evidence) and the low activity levels (as inferred from visitation rates), which together support the assumption of high inertia and low switching propensity. The absence of direct evidence for switching behavior is acknowledged, and the lack of qualitative evidence for higher or lower motivation is correctly noted. The application of the template distribution is appropriate, and the confidence level is well-calibrated given the available evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort', which is classified as a high friction behavior. The baseline for this type is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows this segment (Stable Seniors) spends a significant amount on council tax, utilities, and related outgoings, but there is no evidence of high engagement with switching or cost-saving behaviors (e.g., low attendance at sporting events and places of worship, suggesting low activity levels). There is no direct evidence of high motivation to switch suppliers, and inertia is likely strong in this older, stable segment. No demographic calibration is warranted (elderly, but not a healthcare concept). No qualitative evidence suggests higher or lower agreement. Therefore, the template distribution is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong alignment with the evidence and the concept-specific correction for this item.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item about the perceived value of switching utility suppliers. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related expenses (value=2851.52), which suggests utilities are a significant cost for this segment (Stable Seniors). However, direct evidence of switching behavior or strong motivation to switch is absent. The baseline for this concept (per v2 prompt) is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. This is supported by the fact that older, stable segments typically show higher inertia and lower switching rates, even when costs are high. The sporting events and places of worship visitation rates are low, indicating a less active lifestyle, which may correlate with lower propensity to engage in effortful switching. No qualitative evidence suggests unusually high or low motivation to switch. Therefore, the concept-specific correction is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative relevance but lack of direct switching data.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as a high-friction behavior. The V2 template for this is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence from the segment (Stable Seniors) shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting potential benefit from switching), but there is no direct evidence of high switching activity or strong motivation to switch. Attendance at sporting events and places of worship is low, indicating a less active lifestyle, which may correlate with lower likelihood to engage in effortful switching behaviors. No qualitative evidence suggests unusually high or low motivation to switch. Therefore, the baseline template is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong segment match and relevant quantitative context, but not maximal due to lack of direct switching data.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as a high friction behavior. The baseline for this type is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows this segment (Stable Seniors) has high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related bills, but there is no evidence of high engagement with switching or cost-saving behaviors (e.g., low attendance at sporting events and places of worship suggests low activity levels). No qualitative evidence suggests a strong motivation to switch. Demographic calibration for elderly (normally +8pp for healthcare, not utilities) is not applied here. No direct evidence of higher or lower agreement, so the concept-specific correction for switching utilities (reduce by 15pp from prior over-prediction) is used. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and direct template match.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort', which is classified as a high friction behavior. The baseline for high friction behavior is: SA 5%, A 18%, N 27%, D 28%, SD 22%. For 'Switching utilities', the V2 prompt specifies a concept-specific correction: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows this segment (Stable Seniors) has high outgoings on utilities (suggesting potential benefit from switching), but their low engagement in other activities (e.g., only 17% attend sporting events, 8% places of worship) suggests low behavioral activation and inertia. No direct evidence suggests higher willingness to switch. Therefore, I use the concept-specific correction without further upward adjustment. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and relevant quantitative context, but no direct survey data on switching attitudes.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.86
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence: low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks, pet care) among 'stable seniors', and moderate rates for higher-ticket items (home appliances, holiday/travel). This supports the conclusion that while there is a preference for offline (potentially cash) transactions, digital adoption is not negligible. The application of a concept-specific correction (-12pp from the attitude baseline) is clearly explained and consistently applied. The lack of strong qualitative evidence is acknowledged, and the evidence hierarchy is respected, with quantitative data dominating. The predicted distribution (SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%) is well-supported by the evidence and the correction logic. No further revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 23.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'), but the most relevant quantitative evidence is behavioral: only 16% (alcoholic drinks) and 21% (pet care) of 'stable seniors' bought these items online, suggesting a strong preference for offline (potentially cash) transactions. However, for higher-ticket items (home appliances, travel), online purchase rates are much higher (52-55%), indicating that even this group is not universally cash-oriented. The concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to reduce agreement by 12pp from the attitude baseline, reflecting higher digital adoption than attitudes suggest. Therefore, I apply the corrected template: SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence and a clear concept-specific correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'), but the quantitative evidence shows very low online purchase rates for Alcoholic drinks (16%) and Pet care (21%) among stable seniors, with moderate rates for Home appliances (52%) and Holiday/travel (55%). This suggests a strong preference for offline (likely cash or card) transactions for everyday items, but some digital adoption for larger purchases. The concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to reduce agreement by 12pp from the attitude baseline, reflecting higher digital adoption than attitudes suggest. Therefore, the predicted distribution is: Strongly agree 12%, Slightly agree 23%, Neither 28%, Slightly disagree 22%, Strongly disagree 15%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and a clear concept-specific correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'), so the attitude baseline is the starting point. However, direct quantitative evidence from the stable seniors segment shows very low online purchase rates for alcoholic drinks (16%) and pet care (21%), but moderate rates for home appliances (52%) and holiday/travel (55%). This suggests that while online adoption is moderate for some categories, there is still a significant preference for offline (potentially cash) transactions, especially for everyday or lower-value items. The concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to reduce agreement by 12pp from the attitude baseline, reflecting higher digital adoption than attitudes suggest. No strong qualitative evidence is available, so the quantitative data dominates. The final distribution is: SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and a clear concept-specific correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases' for the ACORN 'stable seniors' segment. This is an attitude item, but the most relevant quantitative evidence is the low online purchase rates for low-friction, everyday categories (alcoholic drinks: 16%, pet care: 21%), with higher rates for less frequent, higher-value items (home appliances: 52%, holiday/travel: 55%). This suggests that for everyday purchases, this group is much less likely to use online/digital methods, implying a higher preference for cash or in-person payment. However, the concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to REDUCE by 12pp from the attitude baseline, reflecting that digital adoption is higher than attitudes suggest. Applying the corrected template (SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%) fits the evidence: it acknowledges a moderate but not overwhelming preference for cash, with a significant minority neutral or disagreeing. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and a direct concept-specific correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: 1. Concept type: This is an attitude item, but with a known tendency for over-prediction in older segments. The V2 template for 'like to use cash' is: SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15% (already corrected for +12pp bias).
2. Quantitative evidence: Direct data for this segment (stable seniors) shows very low online purchase rates for low-friction categories (alcoholic drinks 16%, pet care 21%), and only moderate for higher-friction (home appliances 52%, holiday/travel 55%). This suggests a strong preference for offline/cash, but not universal.
3. Demographic calibration: Stable seniors are older, so if anything, the template is slightly conservative, but the correction already accounts for this.
4. Qualitative: No direct pen portrait, but the segment is known for traditional habits.
5. Evidence hierarchy: Quantitative data (low online use) supports higher cash preference, but the concept-specific correction already incorporates this. No further upward adjustment is justified.
6. Variance: The prediction is not clustered around the mean, and matches the corrected template.
Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and concept-specific correction.
