### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.78
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The topline quantitative data relates to behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging current accounts by phone) and demographic splits, but none are directly attitudinal or highly relevant to a specific attitude concept. The concept is only labeled as 'attitude' with no further semantic cues, so defaulting to the 'Generic Attitude' baseline is appropriate. The rationale consistently notes the lack of direct evidence and the moderate relevance of the quantitative data, supporting the use of the generic baseline. Confidence is moderate-high due to the clear fit with the semantic category and absence of contradictory evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is labeled only as 'Concept' with item type 'attitude' and no further semantic cues. The quantitative evidence provided relates to behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging current accounts by phone) and demographic splits (country of birth), but none are directly relevant to a specific attitude concept. With no direct evidence, I must default to the semantic category decision tree. Since the concept is unspecified and does not fit cost-consciousness, self-reliance, debt/risk aversion, or other more specific categories, it falls under 'Generic Attitude' (baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). No demographic calibration is warranted due to lack of context. Confidence is moderate-high due to clear category fit and lack of overriding evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is labeled as 'attitude' with no further specifics, so I must default to semantic category classification. The quantitative evidence provided is about behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging current accounts by phone), with agreement rates of 14-23%, which are low. However, these are behaviors, not attitudes. Since the concept is an unspecified attitude, the most conservative and generalizable match is 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' or generic attitude (30% agreement baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). There is no evidence to suggest this is a cost-consciousness, self-reliance, or expensive purchase item. The quantitative evidence is not directly relevant (relevance <0.8 for all but one, and even the highest is 0.79), so it only slightly reinforces the low baseline. Therefore, I use the generic attitude baseline, with no demographic calibration due to lack of specifics. Confidence is moderate-high due to clear category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is labeled as 'attitude' with no further specifics, so the semantic category defaults to 'Generic Attitude' unless evidence suggests otherwise. The quantitative evidence provided relates to behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging current accounts by phone), with low agreement (14-23%), but these are not direct attitudes. No evidence suggests cost-consciousness, self-reliance, or other higher-agreement categories. Therefore, the baseline for a generic attitude (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is used. The confidence is moderate-high due to the lack of direct, highly relevant quantitative evidence for attitudes, but the evidence does not contradict the generic baseline.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is labeled as 'attitude' with no further specifics, so the semantic category defaults to 'Generic Attitude' unless more detail is available. However, the quantitative evidence provided is about behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging a current account by phone), with agreement rates of 14-23%. These are low, suggesting that for this audience (not private households), agreement with related attitudes is also likely to be low. The evidence is moderately relevant (relevance 0.77-0.80), so it should override the generic attitude baseline (which would be ~35% agreement). The final estimate is aligned with the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' or 'Effort-Required Behaviors' category (30% agreement), reflecting the low behavioral uptake and likely low attitudinal agreement. The distribution is thus: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is moderate-high due to the direct quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is labeled as 'attitude' with no further detail, so the semantic category defaults to 'Generic Attitude' unless more context is provided. The quantitative evidence provided relates to behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging accounts by phone) and demographic splits, but none are directly relevant to a specific attitude concept (relevance <0.8 for all but one, and even that is not directly attitudinal). Therefore, the baseline for a generic attitude (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is used. No strong demographic or behavioral evidence justifies deviation from this baseline. Confidence is moderate-high due to the lack of direct evidence but strong category fit.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence: only 19% self-identify as environmentalists and 33% agree that energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating weak environmental attitudes in the 'Not Private Households' segment. The semantic category baseline (~30% agreement) is appropriately applied, and the evidence is used to justify maintaining or slightly lowering the baseline. The qualitative context is acknowledged, and the lack of demographic calibration is correctly noted. The confidence in the estimate is high due to the direct alignment between the evidence and the predicted distribution. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 7.80%
  Slightly agree: 21.60%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.40%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). Quantitative evidence from the same segment shows only 19% agree with 'I consider myself an environmentalist' and 33% agree that 'energy companies do not care about the environment'—both low, confirming weak environmental attitudes in this group. No evidence suggests higher agreement. Demographic calibration is not needed, as 'Not Private Households' is not strongly urban or rural, and the evidence is highly relevant. Therefore, the baseline is maintained, and the evidence supports a low agreement estimate. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA+A). The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (19%) and 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' (33%). Both show low to moderate agreement, supporting the low baseline. The audience is 'Not Private Households', which may slightly depress agreement further due to less personal stake in environmental issues at events. No strong demographic calibration applies. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline, with a slight downward nudge due to the 19% agreement on self-identification as environmentalist.
Run 3: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=20.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA+A). The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (19%) and 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' (33%), both showing low to moderate agreement with environmental attitudes in this segment (ACORN: Not Private Households). The 19% figure for self-identification as an environmentalist is especially low, suggesting even less agreement than the category baseline. Therefore, I weight the evidence (80% direct quantitative, 20% category baseline), resulting in a slightly lower agreement than the baseline: SA 7%, A 20%, N 32%, D 25%, SD 16%. Confidence is high due to strong direct evidence and clear category fit.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). The strongest quantitative evidence is that only 19% consider themselves environmentalists and 33% think energy companies don't care about the environment, both indicating low environmental identification and moderate skepticism. No evidence suggests higher agreement, and the audience (Not Private Households) is unlikely to be more environmentally engaged than average. Therefore, the baseline is maintained, with a slight lean toward neutrality and disagreement, matching the evidence. Confidence is high due to strong direct evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows only 19% agree with 'I consider myself an environmentalist' and 33% agree that 'energy companies do not care about the environment' (which is a negative attitude toward companies, not a positive environmental stance). These low agreement rates confirm that environmental attitudes are not strongly held in this segment. No evidence suggests higher agreement, and the segment ('Not Private Households') does not indicate a demographic likely to be more environmentally progressive. Therefore, the baseline category is appropriate, and the evidence supports keeping agreement low. Distribution is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the high outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels (value=101.75, relevance=0.98), which is highly relevant quantitative evidence supporting the salience of cost-saving behaviors. The category baseline for cost-consciousness behaviors (~70% agreement) is appropriate and well-supported by the evidence. There is no conflicting attitudinal or demographic evidence that would warrant deviation from this baseline. The minor adjustments in the distribution (e.g., a slight nudge upward in 'Strongly agree' due to high outgoings) are methodologically sound. The qualitative evidence is acknowledged as less relevant but does not undermine the quantitative justification. Overall, the estimate is well-grounded in the provided evidence and does not require revision.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.80%
  Slightly agree: 39.60%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 14.60%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is a classic example of a 'Cost-Consciousness Behavior' (Category 1). This category is characterized by high agreement (baseline ~70%) because saving money on unavoidable household expenses is a universal motivator, regardless of income or demographic. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on housing, water, electricity, and gas, which further supports the salience of this behavior for the segment. There is no evidence of strong digital or local-business attitudes that would shift this baseline. No demographic calibration is needed as the context is not private households, but the cost-saving motive remains dominant. Thus, the estimate closely follows the category baseline: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving on utility bills is a universal, low-effort, money-saving action. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels (value=101.75), which further incentivizes efforts to reduce usage. No evidence suggests a demographic or attitudinal deviation from the baseline. Other attitudes (e.g., support for local businesses) are much lower, but these are not directly related to cost-saving behaviors. Therefore, the baseline distribution is appropriate, with high agreement and low disagreement. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is a classic example of a 'Cost-Consciousness Behavior'—it is a money-saving action with minimal effort, which is universally appealing across demographics. The category baseline is high (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%). The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, etc., which further incentivizes efforts to reduce these costs. There is no evidence of strong digital or attitudinal resistance to cost-saving behaviors in the segment. No demographic calibration is needed as the context is not private households, but the cost-saving motive remains strong. The final estimate is very close to the category baseline, with a slight nudge upward due to the high relevance of outgoings data. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is a classic example of a 'Cost-Consciousness Behavior'—it is a low-effort, money-saving action that is broadly appealing across demographics. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on housing, water, electricity, and gas (value=101.75), which further incentivizes efforts to reduce these costs. There is no evidence of strong digital or attitudinal barriers to such behaviors in this segment. The baseline for this category is high (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%), and the evidence does not suggest deviation from this. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is a classic example of a cost-consciousness behavior. This category is characterized by high agreement (baseline ~70%) because saving money on unavoidable household bills is a universal motivator, regardless of income or demographic. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on housing, water, electricity, and gas, which further incentivizes efforts to reduce usage. There is no evidence of significant digital or attitudinal barriers to this behavior in the segment. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated here, so the baseline is only slightly adjusted (+1pp to SA for high outgoings). The final estimate is: Strongly agree 32%, Slightly agree 39%, Neither 14%, Slightly disagree 10%, Strongly disagree 5%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently identifies the correct semantic category ('Expensive Purchases/Commitments'), uses the most relevant quantitative anchor ('Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions', value=0.36), and appropriately calibrates the agreement levels above the baseline for this category. The reasoning acknowledges the difference between environmental friendliness and fuel consumption, and correctly notes that 'most important' is a strong claim, so agreement should not be overstated. The distribution is plausible, with most respondents neutral or disagreeing, and a minority agreeing. Confidence is high due to the strong relevance and quality of the quantitative evidence, and the absence of contradictory qualitative or demographic data. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 7.00%
  Slightly agree: 18.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 27.00%
  Strongly disagree: 20.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, as it relates to a high-cost purchase and prioritization of a specific feature. The closest quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.36), which is a related but not identical concept—environmental friendliness is often correlated with fuel efficiency, but not always prioritized as the most important feature. The baseline for 'Expensive Purchases' is low agreement (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%), reflecting that few people prioritize a single feature above all others when making a major purchase. The evidence (0.36 for environmental friendliness) suggests a slightly higher agreement than baseline, but not dramatically so, as fuel consumption is a practical concern but rarely the sole or top priority for most buyers (other factors like price, reliability, brand, etc. compete). Therefore, I modestly increase agreement from the baseline, but keep the majority in 'neither' or 'disagree'. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear semantic fit.
Run 2: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, as it refers to a high-cost decision (car purchase) and prioritization of a specific feature. The closest quantitative evidence is the 0.36 agreement for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' as an important car-buying feature, which is related but not identical—fuel consumption is more cost-focused, but both are not universal priorities. The baseline for this category is low (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). The evidence (0.36) is slightly above baseline, so I adjust agreement up by ~10pp, but not more, since 'most important' is a strong claim and most buyers consider multiple factors (price, brand, reliability, etc.). Demographic calibration is minimal as the segment is not specified as high or low income. Confidence is high due to strong relevance of the evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') falls under CATEGORY 5: EXPENSIVE PURCHASES/COMMITMENTS. This category typically has low agreement (~15-20%) because it requires prioritizing a specific feature (fuel consumption) over all others in a high-cost context (buying a car), which is rarely universal. 

Relevant quantitative evidence: The closest direct evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.36, relevance=0.98). While not identical, environmental friendliness and low CO2 are closely related to fuel consumption, as both are often proxies for efficiency. This suggests that about 36% agree with prioritizing an environmentally linked feature, but this is likely higher than for fuel consumption alone, which is less aspirational and more practical. 

Other evidence: Attitudes toward energy companies and insurance are lower (0.33 and 0.18), supporting the idea that strong agreement on any single car feature is not high. 

Calibration: No strong demographic evidence to shift the baseline. The evidence (0.36) is above the category baseline (0.15), so I weight the evidence at 80% and the baseline at 20%, resulting in a blended agreement of about 20-22%. 

Distribution: Most will be neutral or slightly disagree, with a minority strongly agreeing. The distribution reflects the evidence and the category's typical pattern.

Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is best classified as 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' (Category 5), since it refers to a high-cost decision and prioritization among features. The closest quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.36), which is a related but not identical environmental/efficiency feature. This suggests that only about 36% agree with prioritizing environmental/efficiency features, which is higher than the baseline for expensive purchase priorities (15%). However, 'fuel consumption' is a practical, cost-saving feature, so it may attract slightly more agreement than purely environmental features, but less than universal cost-saving behaviors. Given the evidence, I weight the agreement up from the baseline (15%) to about 25% (7% strongly agree, 18% slightly agree), with a large neutral/disagree segment, reflecting that many buyers prioritize other features (e.g., price, reliability, brand). The distribution maintains high variance, with a confidence of 0.82 due to strong quantitative evidence and clear semantic fit.
Run 5: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: This concept falls under 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' (category 5), as it concerns a major purchase (a new car) and prioritizing a specific feature (fuel consumption) above all others. The baseline for this category is low agreement (~15-20%) because most people have multiple priorities (price, brand, comfort, etc.) and not everyone buys new cars. 

Evidence: The closest quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (0.36), which is a related but not identical concept. Environmental friendliness is generally less prioritized than cost-saving (fuel consumption), but the agreement is still only 36%. This suggests that even among this segment, single-feature prioritization is not dominant. Other evidence (insurance importance 0.18, pet care research 0.29) supports the pattern that expensive/commitment-heavy choices have low strong agreement. 

Calibration: No strong demographic evidence to shift the baseline. The segment is not described as especially cost-obsessed or environmentally focused. 

Distribution: Weighted toward 'neither' and 'slightly disagree', with a minority agreeing. This reflects the reality that while fuel consumption is important, it is rarely the single most important feature for most buyers.

Confidence: High, as the evidence is directly relevant and matches the learned pattern for this semantic category.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative indicator ('I do not mind taking risks with my money', value=0.44), which is a strong counterpoint to debt aversion and directly informs the estimate. The other available quantitative evidence is correctly identified as less relevant, and the absence of strong qualitative or demographic modifiers is appropriately noted. The use of the semantic category baseline (~43% agreement) is reasonable, and the decision not to adjust it significantly is well-supported by the evidence. The repeated rationale across runs demonstrates consistency and careful consideration of the evidence. No major corrective feedback is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 12.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' falls under the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which typically sees moderate agreement (~43%). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the segment's agreement with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (value=0.44), indicating a relatively high risk tolerance for this group. This suggests that aversion to debt may be lower than the general population baseline. Other evidence (helping out in the community, climate change concern, likelihood to move) is less directly relevant. No strong demographic or qualitative cues are present to shift the baseline. Therefore, I use the category baseline (SA 18%, A 25%, N 25%, D 20%, SD 12%) without major adjustment, as the risk-tolerant evidence slightly counterbalances any upward calibration. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative relevance.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~43%. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (value=0.44), which is a direct attitudinal counterpoint: if 44% are risk-tolerant, the remainder are risk-averse, supporting the baseline. Other evidence (community involvement, climate concern, likelihood to move) is less directly relevant. No strong demographic or qualitative modifiers are present. The distribution is centered with moderate agreement, reflecting cultural variation and the evidence provided. Confidence is high due to the strong relevance of the risk attitude evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: the segment's agreement with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' is 0.44 (44%), indicating a relatively high risk tolerance, which suggests a lower-than-average aversion to debt. Other segment evidence (e.g., low community engagement, moderate likelihood to move) does not directly affect debt attitudes. No strong demographic calibrations are indicated. Therefore, the baseline is maintained, with a slight downward tilt in agreement due to the segment's higher risk tolerance. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence relevance.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: the segment's agreement with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' is 0.44 (44%), suggesting a moderate tolerance for financial risk, which implies a moderate but not high aversion to debt. Other evidence (helping out in the community, climate change concern, likelihood to move) is less directly relevant. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence is present to shift the baseline. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline, with a slight nudge toward less agreement due to the relatively high risk tolerance in the segment. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: the closest related item is 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (value=0.44), suggesting that risk tolerance is moderate in this segment. The other evidence (helping out in the community, climate change attitudes, likelihood to move) is less directly relevant and does not indicate a strong deviation from the baseline. No demographic calibration is warranted based on the provided context. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline, with moderate confidence due to strong relevance of the risk attitude evidence.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.78
Critic confidence: 0.92
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence and the methodological approach. The rationale consistently applies the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category baseline, which is appropriate for the statement 'I am very good at managing money.' The quantitative evidence (e.g., 22% manage savings online, 62% privately owned car) is acknowledged as only weakly related but not contradictory, and the qualitative note about 'Not Private Households' is reasonably interpreted as having a modest potential effect on financial autonomy. The repeated rationale across runs demonstrates a careful consideration of both direct and indirect evidence, and the decision not to adjust the baseline is well-supported. No major evidence is overlooked, and the confidence level is appropriately moderate-to-high given the indirectness of the evidence. No corrective feedback is necessary.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 8.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' is a classic example of the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category. This type of statement typically receives high agreement due to positive self-concept and social desirability bias, even among populations with mixed financial circumstances. The baseline for this category is 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 20% neither, 12% slightly disagree, and 8% strongly disagree (60% agreement). 

The quantitative evidence provided does not directly measure self-assessed money management skill, but the relatively low rate of online savings account management (22%) and moderate car ownership (62%) suggest a mixed but not highly affluent or financially sophisticated segment. However, these do not directly contradict the baseline, as self-perception of money management is often inflated compared to actual behaviors. The qualitative note ('Not Private Households') may indicate institutional or communal living, which could slightly reduce the sense of personal financial agency, but not enough to override the strong social desirability effect. 

Therefore, the baseline distribution for 'Self-Reliance Identity' is applied with high confidence, with no major demographic or evidence-based adjustments.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement due to positive self-concept and social desirability bias. The provided quantitative evidence is only weakly related (e.g., 22% manage savings online, 62% have a privately owned car), but does not directly measure self-assessed money management skill. The ACORN 'Not Private Households' segment may include institutional or communal living, which could slightly lower financial autonomy, but the effect is likely modest. No strong evidence to override the category baseline. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the Self-Reliance Identity baseline: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is moderately high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees moderate-to-high agreement (baseline: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%). This is because most people tend to rate themselves positively on competence and responsibility, influenced by social desirability bias. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 22% manage savings online, 62% have a privately owned car) does not directly measure self-assessed money management skill, but does suggest a moderate level of financial engagement and independence, which supports the baseline. The ACORN 'Not Private Households' segment may include institutional or communal living, which could slightly lower financial autonomy, but not enough to shift the baseline significantly. No strong evidence to override the category baseline. Confidence is high due to strong fit with the self-reliance identity pattern and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement (SA+A). This is because positive self-assessments of competence are socially desirable and most people rate themselves above average in such domains. The provided quantitative evidence does not directly address self-perceived money management skill, but does show moderate engagement with financial tools (22% manage savings online), and a high rate of private car ownership (62%), suggesting some financial stability. The ACORN 'Not Private Households' segment may include institutional or communal living, which could slightly lower financial autonomy, but not enough to shift the baseline substantially. No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the category baseline. Thus, the estimate remains close to the 60% agreement pattern, with moderate confidence due to indirect evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement due to positive self-concept and social desirability bias. The provided quantitative evidence is only weakly related (e.g., 22% manage savings online, 62% have a privately owned car), but does not directly measure self-assessed money management skill. The ACORN 'Not Private Households' segment may include institutional or communal living, which could slightly lower financial autonomy, but this effect is likely small. No strong evidence to override the category baseline, so the estimate remains close to the 60% agreement pattern. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong category fit but limited direct evidence.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently anchors the prediction to the most relevant quantitative evidence ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', value=0.19, relevance=0.98), which is a close semantic and behavioral match for the insurance attitude in question. The semantic category ('Expensive Purchases/Commitments') is appropriately identified, and the baseline agreement rates are transparently referenced and applied. The lack of demographic or qualitative evidence is acknowledged, and the absence of such evidence is correctly interpreted as a reason not to adjust the baseline further. The repeated runs show internal consistency, and the minor upward adjustment from the baseline is well explained by the slightly higher quantitative anchor. Confidence is high due to the strong alignment between the evidence and the estimate. No corrective feedback is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 4.00%
  Slightly agree: 13.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 23.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category. This category is characterized by low agreement (15-20%) because insurance is a significant recurring cost, and most people do not prioritize being 'well insured for everything' due to cost barriers and perceived necessity. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.19, relevance=0.98), which is also a high-cost, risk-mitigation attitude and shows low agreement (19%). No evidence suggests higher agreement for insurance priorities in this segment. Demographic calibrations are not applied due to lack of specific segment details, but the baseline for this category is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%. The evidence supports this baseline, so the estimate is kept close to it. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and highly relevant quantitative anchor.
Run 2: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'It is important to be well insured for everything' involves a high-cost, comprehensive financial commitment, which typically receives low agreement due to cost barriers and the fact that not everyone prioritizes or can afford extensive insurance. The category baseline is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). Quantitative evidence from a highly relevant item ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', value=0.19, relevance=0.98) supports a low agreement pattern for expensive/major financial priorities in this segment. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence to shift the baseline. Therefore, the estimate is close to the category baseline, with a slight upward nudge for the segment's moderate mass-market orientation, but not enough to move it out of the low-agreement range. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between category and evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') fits the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) due to the high cost and non-universality of comprehensive insurance. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the 0.19 agreement for 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (relevance 0.98), which is a similar high-cost, risk-averse attitude and supports a low agreement estimate. Other evidence (adverts, mass market clothing) is less relevant but does not suggest higher agreement. No strong demographic calibration is indicated for this segment. Therefore, the estimate is anchored close to the category baseline, with a slight upward nudge for the moderate relevance of the evidence, resulting in 17% agreement (4% strongly, 13% slightly), 28% neutral, and 55% disagreement (32% slightly, 23% strongly).
Run 4: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') falls into the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category. This category is characterized by low agreement (~15%) because insurance is a costly, non-universal priority, and many people are under-insured or only selectively insured. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.19, relevance=0.98), which is also a high-cost, risk-mitigation attitude and supports a low agreement baseline. No evidence suggests this segment is unusually risk-averse or affluent, so no demographic calibration is applied. The resulting estimate is close to the category baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%. Minor upward adjustment for the slightly higher evidence value (0.19 vs. 0.15 baseline) yields SA 4%, A 13%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which typically sees low agreement (~15%) due to the high cost and non-universality of comprehensive insurance. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.19, relevance=0.98), which is a similar high-cost, risk-mitigation attitude and supports a low agreement baseline. Other evidence (adverts, mass market clothing) is less relevant. No strong demographic calibration is indicated for this segment. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%, with a slight upward nudge for the quantitative evidence (19% agreement) to SA 4%, A 13%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and highly relevant quantitative anchor.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently explains that while the target concept ('Healthy Eating') is attitudinal, the quantitative evidence provided (low rates of vegan/vegetarian diets, majority meat-eating) indicates that strong behavioral alignment with healthy eating is limited. This supports a moderate level of agreement with the attitude, with many respondents likely neutral or only slightly agreeing. The distribution (SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%) is well-grounded in both the semantic baseline for 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' and the quantitative evidence, and the confidence is appropriately high. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 26.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the provided quantitative evidence is about actual eating behaviors (vegan, vegetarian, meat-eating rates). The low prevalence of vegan (2%) and vegetarian (8%) diets, with a majority (68%) eating meat, suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual adoption of strict healthy eating behaviors is low. This aligns with the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category (~38% agreement baseline). The evidence is highly relevant (relevance >0.95), so it should override the baseline: the low rates of restrictive diets indicate that strong agreement with healthy eating attitudes is likely limited, and many are neutral or only slightly agree. Therefore, the distribution is centered around moderate agreement and neutrality, with a significant minority disagreeing. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept is 'Healthy Eating,' which falls under the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category (baseline: ~38% agreement). The quantitative evidence shows that only 2% are vegan, 8% vegetarian, and 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, while 68% eat meat. This suggests that while some aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary change is limited, reflecting the attitude-behavior gap typical of this category. The evidence supports a moderate level of agreement, not high, as most do not follow restrictive healthy diets. Therefore, the baseline is appropriate, and the distribution is set accordingly. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows that only a small minority are vegan (2%) or vegetarian (8%), with the vast majority (68%) eating meat and 20% identifying as pescatarian, flexitarian, or other. This suggests that while there may be some aspiration toward healthy eating, actual dietary behaviors are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. This fits the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category, which typically sees moderate agreement (~38%). The evidence here suggests even less strong agreement, as most do not follow diets typically associated with strong health consciousness. Therefore, the baseline is used but slightly weighted toward more neutrality and disagreement, reflecting the gap between aspiration and behavior. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows that only a small minority are vegan (2%) or vegetarian (8%), with the majority (68%) eating meat and 20% identifying as pescatarian, flexitarian, or other. This suggests that while there may be some aspiration or positive attitude toward healthy eating, actual dietary behaviors are not strongly aligned with strict healthy eating patterns. The semantic category is 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' (baseline: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%). The evidence supports a moderate level of agreement, with a significant portion neutral or disagreeing, reflecting the gap between attitude and behavior. No strong demographic calibration is warranted based on the provided context. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence provided is about actual eating behaviors (vegan, vegetarian, meat-eating rates). These show that only a small minority follow strict healthy-eating patterns (e.g., vegan 2%, vegetarian 8%, pescatarian/flexitarian/other 20%), while the majority (68%) eat meat. This suggests that while some aspire to healthy eating, actual behavior is moderate. According to the learned semantic categories, 'Healthy Eating' as an attitude fits best under 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' (baseline: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%). The evidence supports this moderate agreement: many may agree in principle, but few follow through with strict dietary changes. No strong demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for agreement with 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale consistently references the semantic category ('Self-Reliance Identity'), which is known to attract higher agreement due to social desirability and cultural norms. The closest quantitative evidence ('I only save for a specific purpose' at 41%) is acknowledged as a more restrictive behavioral statement, and the low behavioral intent for 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (8%) is correctly identified as not directly comparable to attitudinal agreement. The runs appropriately use the category baseline and make minor downward adjustments to reflect the slightly lower agreement in related financial attitudes, without over-interpreting the behavioral data. There is no strong contradictory evidence, and the confidence level is appropriately high. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 24.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.40%
  Strongly disagree: 8.60%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is a positively framed, responsibility-focused attitude, likely to attract social desirability bias and broad agreement, especially in financial contexts. The closest quantitative evidence is 'I only save for a specific purpose' (41% agreement), which is lower, but this is a more restrictive behavioral statement. The other evidence ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 34%) is an effort-based behavior and not directly relevant. No evidence directly contradicts the baseline. Demographic calibrations are not applied due to lack of specific segment cues. Therefore, the category baseline is used: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of conflicting evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=24.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a statement about personal responsibility and competence, and such statements are generally viewed positively due to social desirability and cultural norms around self-sufficiency. The closest quantitative evidence is moderate: 'I only save for a specific purpose' (0.41), which is lower, but this is a more restrictive behavior than the broader attitude of self-responsibility. The evidence for 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' (0.34) and 'I trust financial price comparison sites' (0.53) are less directly relevant but suggest moderate to high agreement with proactive financial attitudes. No evidence suggests a lower baseline is warranted, so the category baseline (SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%) is used. No strong demographic calibration is indicated for this segment. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=23.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a statement about personal responsibility and competence, which tends to be socially desirable and widely endorsed, especially in financial contexts. Quantitative evidence is limited but relevant: the closest is 'I only save for a specific purpose' (0.41 agree) and 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' (0.34 agree), both lower than the baseline, but these are more about specific behaviors or effort rather than identity. The very low agreement for 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (0.08) is about actual planning/behavior, not attitude/identity, so it doesn't directly contradict the higher baseline for self-reliance attitudes. Therefore, I use the category baseline (SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%) with a slight downward adjustment (about -3pp from agreement) to reflect the somewhat lower agreement in this segment for related financial attitudes. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and moderate supporting evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=24.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees moderate-to-high agreement (~60%) due to social desirability and positive self-concept. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (0.08), which is low, but this measures actual planning/behavior, not attitude. Attitudinal evidence ('I only save for a specific purpose' 0.41, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' 0.34) is lower, but these are not direct self-reliance statements. No evidence directly contradicts the baseline, so I use the category baseline (SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%) with a slight downward adjustment (SA -1pp, A -1pp, D +1pp, SD +1pp) to reflect the modestly lower agreement in related financial attitudes. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of strong contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=24.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is a positive self-concept/competence statement, and social desirability bias tends to inflate agreement. The closest quantitative evidence is 'I only save for a specific purpose' (0.41), which is lower, but this is a more restrictive behavioral attitude. The other evidence ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 0.34) is an effort-based behavior and not directly relevant. The core concept here is about personal responsibility, not effort or specific saving behavior. No strong evidence to override the category baseline, so I use the Self-Reliance Identity baseline (SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%). No major demographic calibration is indicated for this segment. Confidence is high due to strong semantic fit and lack of conflicting evidence.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category, which is appropriate for the statement about switching utility suppliers. The topline quantitative evidence (high outgoings on utilities) is correctly interpreted as a potential motivator, but the lack of direct evidence for proactive behavior or reduced effort aversion in this segment is properly noted. The repeated use of the baseline (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is well-supported by both the semantic category and the available evidence. No additional demographic or behavioral evidence is present to warrant deviation from this baseline. The confidence is high due to the strong alignment between the evidence and the predicted pattern. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, while switching utilities can save money, it requires time, research, and administrative effort—barriers that deter many people. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting potential savings), but this does not directly translate to willingness to expend effort. No evidence suggests this segment is unusually proactive or effort-tolerant. Therefore, the baseline for effort-required behaviors (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of evidence for deviation.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, while switching utilities can save money (cost-consciousness), the perceived hassle and time investment create significant inertia. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities, which could motivate switching, but there is no direct evidence that this group actually values or undertakes the effort. The baseline for this category is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. No strong demographic or contextual evidence justifies deviation from this baseline. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category is characterized by actions that require significant time or effort, not just a simple cost-saving step. While switching utilities can save money (which would otherwise push agreement higher), the key phrase 'worth the effort' triggers effort aversion, which is well-documented to suppress agreement rates. The baseline for this category is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities, which could slightly increase agreement, but not enough to override the effort aversion pattern. No strong demographic calibration is indicated by the evidence. Therefore, the baseline is used with minor upward adjustment for cost salience, but the overall agreement remains low. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. While switching utilities can save money (cost-consciousness), the key phrase is 'worth the effort', which research shows sharply reduces agreement due to effort aversion and inertia. The baseline for this category is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting some incentive to switch), but this does not override the general pattern that most people do not find switching utilities 'worth the effort'—the friction and perceived hassle are well-documented barriers. No strong demographic calibration is indicated for this segment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the learned semantic pattern and supporting evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, although switching suppliers can save money, it requires time, research, and administrative effort—barriers that deter many people. The quantitative evidence provided (high outgoings on utilities, but no direct evidence of switching behavior or high engagement with such tasks) does not suggest higher-than-baseline agreement. There is no evidence of unusually high motivation or ease in this segment. Therefore, the baseline for 'Effort-Required Behaviors' (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of evidence to shift the baseline.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The topline quantitative data on online purchase rates for various categories among 'Not Private Households' is directly relevant as a proxy for digital payment adoption, and the rationale consistently links lower online purchase rates to a higher likelihood of cash preference. The qualitative context about the segment (potentially older or institutionally housed populations) is appropriately considered, and the estimate is kept close to the semantic category baseline, with minor adjustments reflecting the evidence. The repeated rationales demonstrate a clear, methodical approach, and the confidence level is warranted. No major gaps or misinterpretations are present, so no corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 24.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%

Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~37% agreement (SA+A). The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for this segment (e.g., 25% for alcohol, 31% for pet care, 53% for home appliances, 66% for holiday/travel), suggesting a moderate but not overwhelming preference for non-digital payment methods. This supports the idea that cash preference is still relevant, especially in 'Not Private Households' (which may include older or institutionally housed populations, who tend to use cash more). No evidence suggests a dramatic deviation from the baseline, so the estimate is close to the category default. Confidence is high due to strong relevance of the online purchase rates as a proxy for digital payment adoption.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('I like to use cash when making purchases') fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~37% agreement (SA+A). The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for this segment (e.g., 25% for alcohol, 31% for pet care, 53% for home appliances, 66% for holiday/travel), suggesting a moderate but not overwhelming adoption of digital payments. This supports the idea that cash preference is still present but not dominant. The segment ('Not Private Households') may include institutional or communal living, which could slightly reduce cash preference compared to the general population, but not dramatically. Therefore, the baseline is appropriate, and the evidence does not warrant a major adjustment. The distribution is kept close to the category baseline, with a slight nudge toward neutrality due to the moderate online purchase rates. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' falls under the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which typically sees moderate agreement (~35-40%) due to generational and contextual variation. The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 25%, pet care 31%), suggesting a higher-than-average preference for offline (potentially cash) transactions in this segment. However, for higher-ticket items (home appliances 53%, holiday/travel 66%), online is more common, but these are less frequent purchases. The segment 'Not Private Households' may include institutional or communal living, which could slightly reduce cash preference due to shared or managed finances, but the evidence is not strong enough to override the baseline. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline, with a slight tilt toward neutrality and disagreement due to the moderate online adoption rates. Confidence is high due to strong relevance of the quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~37% agreement (SA+A). The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for this segment (e.g., 25% for alcohol, 31% for pet care, 53% for home appliances, 66% for holiday/travel), suggesting a lower digital adoption and a likely higher preference for traditional payment methods like cash. However, the highest online rates are for expensive/occasional purchases (holidays, appliances), while everyday items (alcohol, pet care) remain low, reinforcing the cash preference for routine transactions. The segment 'Not Private Households' may include older or institutional populations, who tend to prefer cash more than the general population. Therefore, the baseline is maintained, with a slight upward calibration for this segment's likely age and digital lag. The final estimate is: Strongly agree 13%, Slightly agree 24%, Neither 28%, Slightly disagree 22%, Strongly disagree 13%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear category fit.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~37% agreement (SA+A). The quantitative evidence provided is about online purchase rates for various categories among 'Not Private Households' (e.g., alcohol 25%, pet care 31%, home appliances 53%, holidays 66%). These rates are generally lower than the UK average for online shopping, suggesting this segment is less digitally engaged and may have a higher preference for cash than the general population. However, the highest online rate is still only 66% (holidays), and for everyday items like alcohol and pet care, it's much lower (25-31%). This supports the baseline or possibly a slight upward calibration. No strong demographic evidence suggests a major shift from the baseline. Therefore, the estimate is: Strongly agree 13%, Slightly agree 24%, Neither 28%, Slightly disagree 22%, Strongly disagree 13%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative relevance.
