### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.70
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale for applying the V4 baseline for attitude concepts is clearly explained, and the lack of direct, concept-specific quantitative or qualitative evidence supports the decision not to deviate from the baseline. The demographic segment (Not Private Households) does not trigger additional calibration, as per the stated rules. The confidence is appropriately moderate-high, reflecting the strong fit to the template and absence of contradictory or directly relevant evidence. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction or strong demographic calibration indicated by the provided evidence. The quantitative evidence relates to account management and country of birth, but does not directly inform the attitude concept, so the general baseline is most appropriate. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence for the specific concept.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. No concept-specific correction is indicated (the prompt refers only to 'Concept'), and there is no evidence suggesting a need to deviate from the baseline. The quantitative evidence provided relates to country of birth and account management preferences, but these are not directly relevant to the attitude concept in question. The demographic segment (Not Private Households) does not trigger any additional calibration, as the V4 demographic adjustments are only applied for strong, direct relevance. Therefore, the general attitude baseline is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the absence of conflicting data.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction required, and the provided quantitative evidence is not directly related to the attitude concept in question, so it does not warrant further adjustment. The demographic segment (Not Private Households) does not trigger a strong calibration (demographic adjustments are now reduced by 50% in V4 and only applied if directly relevant). No qualitative evidence suggests deviation from the baseline. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The target concept is classified as an 'attitude', so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction required, as the context does not match any of the high-consistency error concepts (e.g., healthy eating, environmental sustainability). The provided quantitative evidence is not directly related to the concept, so it does not warrant deviation from the baseline. The qualitative notes are minimal and do not indicate a need for adjustment. Demographic calibrations are not triggered, as the segment (Not Private Households) does not map to a high or low agreement demographic. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction or strong demographic calibration needed, as the provided quantitative evidence is not directly related to the target concept and does not indicate a need for adjustment. The qualitative notes are minimal and do not suggest deviation from the baseline. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence for the specific concept.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence: only 19% of the segment consider themselves environmentalists and 33% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating below-average environmental concern. The segment context ('Not Private Households') is appropriately used to further justify downward adjustment from the V4 baseline. The predicted agreement rates (21-25%) are well-supported by the evidence, and the rationale for shifting more respondents into 'neither' and 'disagree' categories is sound. Confidence is high due to the strong alignment between the evidence and the prediction. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 6.40%
  Slightly agree: 16.40%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 32.00%
  Slightly disagree: 26.20%
  Strongly disagree: 19.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=16.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=19.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this item is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows only 19% consider themselves environmentalists and 33% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating lower-than-average environmental concern. This is a 'Not Private Households' segment, which typically scores lower on pro-environmental attitudes. Therefore, I adjust the agreement downward by 6pp from the V4 baseline, resulting in 22% agreement (6% SA, 16% A), and increase disagreement and neutrality accordingly. This is supported by direct quantitative evidence (weight 80%) and segment context. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between evidence and prediction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). However, the quantitative evidence for this segment shows only 19% consider themselves environmentalists and 33% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating below-average environmental concern. This segment (Not Private Households) is typically less engaged and less likely to express strong pro-environmental attitudes. Therefore, I further reduce agreement by 7pp (relative to V4 baseline), shifting more respondents to 'neither' and 'disagree'. This yields a predicted agreement (SA+A) of 21%, which is consistent with the low environmental concern in the evidence. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and clear segment profile.
Run 3: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude' (moderate spread). The V4 baseline for 'environmental sustainability when putting on events' is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), reflecting a -15pp correction due to systematic over-prediction. For 'Not Private Households', quantitative evidence shows only 19% consider themselves environmentalists and 33% are skeptical of energy companies' environmental care, both notably lower than general population averages. This suggests even less agreement with environmental sustainability statements. Therefore, agreement is adjusted downward by ~3pp (relative to V4 baseline), with a corresponding increase in disagreement and neutrality. This yields a distribution of 7% strongly agree, 18% slightly agree, 32% neither, 25% slightly disagree, 18% strongly disagree. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and high relevance of the evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude: 'I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events.' V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), reflecting a -15pp correction for systematic over-prediction. 

Demographic: 'Not Private Households' is a highly atypical, often institutionally housed or transient segment, with very low environmental self-identification (only 19% consider themselves environmentalists) and moderate skepticism toward energy companies (33% think companies don't care about the environment). These values are both below national averages for environmental concern, indicating even lower agreement than the already-low V4 baseline. 

Therefore, I adjust the baseline downward by ~3pp for agreement (to 25% total agree), shifting slightly more into 'neither' and 'disagree' categories. This is supported by the direct quantitative evidence (0.19 environmentalist self-ID) and the qualitative profile of the segment. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). However, the quantitative evidence for this segment ('Not Private Households') shows only 19% consider themselves environmentalists and 33% think energy companies do not care about the environment—both are notably low, indicating weak pro-environmental attitudes. This segment is generally less engaged with environmental issues. Therefore, I further reduce agreement by ~7pp from the V4 baseline, shifting more respondents into 'neither' and 'disagree' categories. This results in a predicted agreement (SA+A) of 21%, which is lower than the general population and consistent with the segment's low environmental engagement. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the V4 guidance that this is a well-calibrated concept with minimal error (|error| < 3pp), and the segment-specific evidence (high outgoings on housing/utilities, moderate digital engagement, low support for local businesses) does not directly contradict the baseline. The closest quantitative anchor ('I make an effort to support local businesses') is acknowledged as being in a different domain, and the lack of direct evidence for this specific behavior is appropriately noted. The decision to retain the V4 baseline is well-supported, and confidence is high due to the strong calibration and absence of contradictory evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.00%
  Slightly agree: 40.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 15.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude with a well-calibrated V3 baseline (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%), and V4 guidance is to keep this unchanged due to minimal error in prior rounds (|error| < 3pp). The segment 'Not Private Households' shows high outgoings on housing and utilities, which may increase salience of energy-saving attitudes. No direct quantitative anchor for this exact item, but the closest attitude ('I make an effort to support local businesses', 0.23) is lower, likely reflecting a different domain. No evidence suggests a need to adjust the well-calibrated baseline. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and V4's cross-class validation.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'behavior (low friction)' but this specific item ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home') is one of the four well-calibrated concepts in V4, so the baseline is SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment is 'Not Private Households', which typically includes institutional or communal living arrangements (e.g., student halls, care homes, hostels), where individuals may have less direct control or incentive over utility usage. However, no direct quantitative evidence is provided for this specific behavior, and the closest attitude ('I make an effort to support local businesses') is low (0.23), suggesting lower-than-average pro-social or effortful behaviors. Despite this, V4 guidance is to keep the well-calibrated baseline unless strong evidence suggests otherwise. Therefore, I retain the V4 baseline for this concept, with moderate confidence due to the segment context possibly lowering actual agreement slightly.
Run 3: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but specifically about energy-saving behavior at home, which is well-calibrated in V4 and should use the standard template: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment 'Not Private Households' shows moderate digital engagement (chat bots: 0.57), low digital confusion (0.18), and low support for local businesses (0.23), but none of these directly contradict the general tendency to try to save on utilities, especially given high outgoings on housing/utilities (101.75). No evidence suggests this group is less likely to try to cut down on energy use than the general population. Therefore, the general template is appropriate, with no demographic calibration needed. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative calibration for this concept.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a 'Behavior (Low Friction)' but is specifically listed as a well-calibrated concept in V4 (error < 3pp), so the V3 baseline is retained: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. The segment 'Not Private Households' shows moderate digital engagement (chatbot ease 0.57, computer confusion 0.18) and low local business support (0.23), but there is no direct evidence suggesting deviation from the general population for this behavior. Outgoings on housing/utilities are high, which may slightly reinforce motivation to cut down, but not enough to warrant deviation from the well-calibrated baseline. No demographic calibration is applied, as V4 guidance is to keep well-calibrated concepts unchanged unless strong evidence exists. Confidence is high due to direct match with a well-calibrated template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude (moderate spread), and for 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', V4 guidance indicates this is a well-calibrated concept (no systematic error, |error| < 3pp), so the baseline is SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment 'Not Private Households' shows moderate digital engagement (chatbot ease 0.57, computer confusion 0.18), and a low tendency to support local businesses (0.23), but these do not directly contradict the energy-saving attitude. No evidence suggests a need to adjust the baseline for this segment. Therefore, the well-calibrated V4 baseline is used. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative calibration and lack of conflicting evidence.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the most relevant quantitative anchor ('environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 36%) and correctly notes that this is a broader concept than 'fuel consumption as the most important feature.' The V4 baseline is appropriately used, reflecting systematic over-prediction in earlier versions and cross-class consistency. The segment ('Not Private Households') does not warrant demographic calibration, and no qualitative evidence suggests deviation from the baseline. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the confidence is appropriately high. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 25.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about fuel consumption being the most important feature when buying a new car. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the segment's agreement that 'environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' are important when buying a car (value=0.36), which is moderately low. This is a closely related but not identical concept, and the value suggests a minority prioritize this feature. According to V4, the baseline for this concept is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting generally low prioritization of fuel consumption as the top feature. The segment is 'Not Private Households', which does not warrant a demographic calibration. No qualitative evidence suggests a higher or lower value. The evidence hierarchy is strong (direct quantitative, highly relevant). Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied without adjustment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' V4 baseline for this concept is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3 and cross-class consistency. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low co2 emissions' at 36%, but this is broader than fuel consumption and likely to overstate agreement for this more specific, high-friction attitude. The segment (Not Private Households) is not affluent and is unlikely to over-index on environmental/fuel priorities when buying a car, so no positive demographic calibration is warranted. The other evidence (energy companies/environment, insurance, pet care) is less directly relevant. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied without adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class consistency and direct quantitative anchor.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about fuel consumption being the most important feature when buying a new car. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 36%, which is closely related but not identical—environmental friendliness is a broader concept than fuel consumption alone. V4 guidance for this concept is to use the corrected baseline for 'fuel consumption important when buying car': SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3. The segment (Not Private Households) does not trigger a demographic calibration, as this group is not specifically high or low income, nor does it have a strong age skew. The provided evidence (36% for environmental friendliness) is higher than the V4 baseline, but since the target concept is more restrictive (fuel consumption as the most important feature), the V4 baseline is appropriate. No qualitative evidence suggests a higher or lower value. Therefore, the V4 template is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class calibration.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about fuel consumption being the most important feature when buying a new car. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 36%, which is a related but slightly broader environmental concern. V4's cross-class analysis shows that 'fuel consumption' is systematically over-predicted, so the corrected baseline for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The segment (Not Private Households) is typically lower income and less likely to prioritize environmental or efficiency features when purchasing a car, so no upward demographic calibration is warranted. The provided evidence (36% for environmental/CO2) is higher than the V4 baseline, but this is for a broader environmental concern, not specifically fuel consumption as the single most important feature. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, and the evidence supports not increasing the agreement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class consistency.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about fuel consumption being the most important feature when buying a new car. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 36%, which is closely related but not identical (environmental friendliness overlaps with fuel consumption, but is not the same as making it the most important feature). According to V4, the baseline for this concept is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting that only a minority prioritize fuel consumption above all else. The segment (Not Private Households) does not warrant a demographic calibration (no evidence of strong deviation from baseline). The supporting evidence (36% for environmental friendliness) is higher than the V4 baseline, but the stricter wording ('most important feature') justifies keeping the lower V4 baseline. No qualitative evidence suggests a higher or lower value. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class calibration.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified based on the evidence provided. The rationale consistently references the V4 baseline, which is well-calibrated for this attitude statement, and considers the segment's quantitative profile: low pro-social engagement, moderate risk tolerance, and no strong evidence of systematic deviation from the baseline for debt aversion. The slight nudge toward more disagreement is reasonable given the higher risk tolerance, but the adjustment is minor and well-explained. The lack of qualitative context is noted but does not undermine the justification, as the quantitative anchors are strong and the concept is historically stable. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), so the V4 attitude baseline applies: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, the segment (ACORN Not Private Households) shows relatively low agreement with other pro-social and risk-averse attitudes: 'Helping out in the community' (0.13), 'Climate change is the biggest threat' (0.24), and 'likely to move' (0.22) are all low, while 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' is relatively high (0.44), suggesting a higher tolerance for risk and possibly debt. However, the concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is well-calibrated in V4 and should not be adjusted unless there is strong evidence. Given the moderate evidence of risk tolerance, I maintain the V4 baseline for attitudes, with a slight nudge toward more disagreement (shift 2pp from 'agree' to 'disagree'). This results in: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to the well-calibrated baseline and moderate supporting evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement, so the V4 attitude baseline applies: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, the segment 'Not Private Households' shows relatively low pro-social engagement (helping out in the community: 13%) and moderate concern for risk (44% do not mind taking risks with money), which may indicate a slightly lower aversion to debt than the general population. However, the concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is well-calibrated in V4 and should not be adjusted unless there is strong evidence. The quantitative evidence does not directly address debt aversion, and the qualitative context is missing. Therefore, I retain the V4 baseline for attitudes, with no demographic calibration applied. Confidence is high due to the well-calibrated nature of this concept and lack of strong contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement, so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). However, the segment 'Not Private Households' shows relatively low agreement with pro-social and risk-averse attitudes: only 13% help out in the community, 24% see climate change as a major threat, and 44% are comfortable taking financial risks. These suggest a somewhat lower-than-average aversion to debt, but not dramatically so. The V4 baseline for this concept is already well-calibrated (43% agreement), and the evidence does not justify a major adjustment. Therefore, I retain the V4 baseline, with a slight nudge toward more disagreement (shift 2pp from 'agree' to 'disagree') to reflect the segment's higher risk tolerance and lower community engagement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors and the concept being well-calibrated in V4.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), so the V4 attitude baseline applies: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, the segment (ACORN Not Private Households) shows relatively low agreement with pro-social and risk-averse attitudes: only 13% help out in the community, 24% see climate change as a major threat, and 44% are willing to take risks with money (suggesting less aversion to risk, possibly less aversion to debt). However, the V3/V4 calibration for this concept is already well-tuned (43% agreement baseline), and the evidence does not strongly suggest a need to lower it further. No strong demographic calibration is warranted (this segment is not especially affluent or risk-averse). Therefore, I retain the well-calibrated V4 baseline for this attitude: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong evidence fit and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' type, so the V4 baseline is SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. This matches the well-calibrated template for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which V3 and V4 analysis found to be nearly perfectly predicted (error <1pp) across all classes, including constrained segments like Not Private Households. The quantitative evidence shows relatively low community engagement (0.13), moderate concern about climate change (0.24), and moderate risk tolerance with money (0.44), but none of these directly contradict the baseline for debt aversion. No strong demographic calibration is needed, as this segment is not flagged for systematic deviation on this item. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of conflicting evidence.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.77
Critic confidence: 0.92
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run is clear and consistently references both the V4 baseline and the specific characteristics of the 'Not Private Households' segment. The downward adjustment in agreement is well-supported by indirect quantitative evidence (notably the low rate of online savings account management and the moderate rate of private car ownership), as well as qualitative understanding of the segment's likely lower financial autonomy. The calibration is cautious, with only modest reductions from the baseline, and the confidence level is appropriately set to moderate-high given the indirect nature of the evidence. No further revision is required.

  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. The V4 baseline for this is SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), but for the 'Not Private Households' segment, we must adjust downward. This segment typically includes communal, institutional, or transient living arrangements (e.g., student halls, care homes, hostels), which often correlate with lower financial autonomy and less direct money management. Quantitative evidence is limited, but the relatively low rate of online savings account management (22%) and the context of the segment suggest slightly lower self-assessed money management skills. Therefore, I reduce agreement by 3pp (to 55%), distributing this mainly from 'strongly agree' and 'slightly agree' to 'neither' and 'slightly disagree.' This maintains the V4 correction for over-prediction and reflects the segment's likely lower financial self-efficacy. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment with segment characteristics and supporting quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is classified as an identity statement. The V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), already incorporating a -6pp correction from V3 due to moderate over-prediction. For the 'Not Private Households' segment, there is no strong evidence to further adjust this baseline: the segment is diverse and includes communal living, institutions, and non-standard households, but there is no direct quantitative evidence suggesting a systematic deviation in self-perceived money management. The available quantitative evidence (e.g., 22% manage savings online, 62% have a privately owned car) does not indicate either a strong positive or negative bias in financial self-efficacy. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied without further demographic calibration. Confidence is moderate-high due to the lack of contradictory evidence and the use of a well-calibrated baseline.
Run 3: Strongly agree=23.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=14.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.77 / Rationale: Concept type is 'identity' (self-assessment of money management skill). V4 baseline for 'good at managing money' is 25/34/20/12/9 (59% agreement), but for 'Not Private Households' (a segment including communal, institutional, or non-traditional households), financial self-efficacy is likely lower than average due to less financial autonomy and lower rates of online account management (only 22% manage savings online). No direct quantitative on self-assessed money management, but indirect evidence (low online banking, only 62% privately own a car) suggests less financial engagement. Therefore, I reduce agreement by 4pp (2pp less SA, 2pp less A), shifting some to 'neither' and 'slightly disagree.' This yields: SA 23%, A 32%, N 22%, D 14%, SD 9%. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong indirect evidence and robust V4 calibration for this concept.
Run 4: Strongly agree=21.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=16.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Concept type is IDENTITY ('I am very good at managing money'). V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10% (57% agreement). However, for 'Not Private Households', qualitative evidence suggests lower financial engagement and stability (e.g., only 22% manage savings online, which is low; only 62% have a privately owned car). This segment typically includes communal, institutional, or transient living arrangements, often with less financial autonomy. Therefore, agreement should be adjusted downward by ~3-4pp from baseline. Quantitative evidence is limited but supports a lower-than-average self-assessment of financial management. Final estimate: 53% agreement (SA+A), with a modest increase in neutrality and slight disagreement. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong concept calibration and segment fit.
Run 5: Strongly agree=22.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=15.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. The V4 baseline for this is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10% (57% agreement), but for this segment (Not Private Households), we must calibrate downward. This group is highly heterogeneous, often including students, communal living, and institutional settings, which tend to have lower financial autonomy and less direct money management. Quantitative evidence is sparse but shows only 22% manage savings online (well below national average), suggesting lower financial engagement. No evidence suggests higher-than-baseline confidence. Therefore, I reduce 'slightly agree' by 3pp and increase 'neither' by 4pp, reflecting greater uncertainty and lower self-assessed competence. The result is a modestly lower agreement rate (54% vs. 57% baseline). Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment between segment profile and the concept.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for agreement with 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 guidance that this is a well-calibrated concept and should use the V3 baseline. The available quantitative evidence (e.g., low agreement with 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') supports the decision not to increase the estimate for this segment. There is no evidence suggesting this group is more likely to value insurance, and the segment's characteristics (Not Private Households) align with the rationale for not adjusting upward. The evidence selection is appropriate, and the confidence in the estimate is high. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is an attitude item. According to the V4 prompt, this specific concept is well-calibrated and should retain the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The quantitative evidence for this segment (Not Private Households) shows low agreement with other 'responsibility' or 'prudent' attitudes (e.g., only 19% agree fuel consumption is most important when buying a car), suggesting a lower tendency toward risk-averse or future-oriented attitudes. There is no evidence to suggest this segment is more likely to value comprehensive insurance than the general population. Therefore, the general template is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative alignment and the concept being well-calibrated in V3/V4.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('It is important to be well insured for everything'). According to the V4 prompt, this item is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence for this segment (Not Private Households) shows low agreement with other 'responsibility' or 'prudent' attitudes (e.g., only 19% agree that fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car), suggesting a low tendency toward risk aversion or forward planning. There is no evidence to suggest this segment is more likely to value insurance than the general population, so the general baseline is appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and strong cross-class calibration for this concept.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything' (attitude). According to the V4 prompt, this is one of the well-calibrated concepts, so the baseline should be: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The segment is 'Not Private Households', which typically scores lower on financial security and insurance attitudes. The only relevant quantitative evidence is for a different but related attitude ('fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', value=0.19), which is low and suggests a low tendency to prioritize practical/financial features. No evidence suggests a higher agreement than the baseline. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied without upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to direct alignment with V4 calibration and lack of evidence to adjust upward.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is an attitude item. According to the V4 prompt, this concept is classified as 'well-calibrated' and should use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The quantitative evidence for this segment (Not Private Households) shows low agreement with similar 'responsibility' or 'prudent' attitudes (e.g., only 19% agree fuel consumption is most important when buying a car), suggesting a low tendency toward risk aversion or forward planning. There is no evidence to suggest this segment is more likely to value comprehensive insurance than the general population. Therefore, the general baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to the direct match with the well-calibrated template and supporting quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything' (attitude). V4 guidance says this item is well-calibrated in V3, so use the template: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The segment is 'Not Private Households', which is a constrained, often lower-income, transient or institutional group. There is no direct insurance quantitative evidence, but the closest anchor is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.19), which is low and suggests practical, cost-focused priorities. This supports the baseline or even a slightly lower agreement, but V4 says not to adjust well-calibrated concepts. Therefore, I use the V4 template unchanged. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' (attitude) is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 correction, which is mandated due to systematic over-prediction in previous versions. The quantitative evidence (very low vegan/vegetarian rates, high meat consumption) supports the application of a lower agreement baseline, and the lack of strong qualitative evidence means no further adjustment is warranted. The repeated runs show robust alignment between the evidence and the correction applied. Confidence is high due to the strong quantitative alignment and the explicit use of a validated cross-class correction. No further revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 26.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is set at 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows very low vegan/vegetarian rates (2% vegan, 8% vegetarian, 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other), and a high proportion eating meat (68%). This suggests that, for this segment (Not Private Households), actual healthy eating behaviors are likely lower than average, but since the question is about attitude (not behavior), and V4 already applies a strong downward correction, no further reduction is made. No strong qualitative evidence is present to further adjust. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and robust V4 correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a -22pp correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction in all classes. The quantitative evidence shows only 2% vegan, 8% vegetarian, and 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 68% eating meat, indicating that healthy eating is not a dominant behavioral norm in this segment. This supports the lower agreement baseline. No strong qualitative evidence is present to suggest higher agreement. Therefore, the V4 corrected distribution for 'Healthy Eating' is applied: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between the quantitative evidence and the V4 cross-class correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a -22pp correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction in all classes. The quantitative evidence shows this segment (Not Private Households) has low vegan (2%), low vegetarian (8%), and moderate pescatarian/flexitarian (20%) rates, with a strong majority eating meat (68%). This suggests lower-than-average engagement with healthy eating attitudes. The V4 corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is 12% strongly agree, 26% slightly agree, 26% neither, 22% slightly disagree, 14% strongly disagree (38% agreement), which fits the evidence and is appropriate for this segment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and the use of a cross-class correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3 across all classes). The corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14% (38% agreement). Quantitative evidence shows this segment is predominantly meat-eating (68%), with very low vegan (2%) and vegetarian (8%) rates, and moderate pescatarian/flexitarian/other (20%). This supports the V4 correction: healthy eating attitudes are likely lower than average, but the V4 cross-class correction already accounts for this. No further demographic calibration is needed, as 'Not Private Households' is not a high-variance outlier for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and robust V4 correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this item due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3 across all classes), so the baseline is set at 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative data for this segment (Not Private Households) shows very low vegan/vegetarian rates (2%/8%), high meat consumption (68%), and moderate pescatarian/flexitarian (20%). This suggests actual healthy eating behaviors are low, which supports the V4 correction. No qualitative evidence contradicts this. Therefore, the standard V4 correction is appropriate, and no further demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class consistency of the error.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.78
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run demonstrates careful consideration of both the quantitative and qualitative evidence provided. The main quantitative anchor ('Plans to use other investments for retirement' at 8%) is correctly interpreted as a behavioral, not attitudinal, measure, and the related financial attitudes (e.g., saving for a purpose, trust in price comparison sites, switching utilities) are appropriately used to infer moderate engagement but not high agency. The V4 baseline is explained as already incorporating corrections for over-prediction and demographic calibration, and the one run that reduces agreement further (Run 5) does so with clear justification based on the segment's likely lower agency. The confidence level is appropriately moderate-high given the evidence. No further revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 24.60%
  Slightly agree: 34.60%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.40%
  Slightly disagree: 13.40%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but with some identity overlap (personal responsibility for retirement). V4 baseline for this concept is 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 18% neither, 13% slightly disagree, 9% strongly disagree (60% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3 due to prior over-prediction. The segment 'Not Private Households' is typically lower-income, less stable, and less likely to have strong financial self-efficacy. However, the only directly relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (8%), which is very low, but this measures behavior/plan, not attitude. Other attitudes (saving for a purpose: 41%, trust price comparison: 53%, switching utilities: 34%) suggest moderate engagement with financial topics but not high agency. No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the V4 baseline for this concept, as the segment is not strongly exceptional in either direction. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong concept calibration but limited direct evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' item with an identity element (personal responsibility for retirement). V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is 25/35/18/13/9 (60% agreement), already corrected for prior over-prediction. The segment (Not Private Households) is typically lower-income, less stable, and less likely to have strong retirement planning behaviors, as evidenced by the very low rate (8%) planning to use other investments for retirement. However, the item is about attitude, not behavior, and such segments often still endorse the principle of personal responsibility even if they do not act on it. No direct quantitative anchor for this exact attitude, but related attitudes (e.g., 'I only save for a specific purpose' at 41%, 'Switching utilities worth the effort' at 34%) suggest moderate agreement with financial self-reliance concepts. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, with no further downward demographic calibration (since V4 already reduced these by 50%). Confidence is moderate-high due to strong cross-class calibration and supporting related attitudes.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an 'identity' statement (self-concept about responsibility for retirement). V4 baseline for this item is: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement), already incorporating a -3pp correction for prior over-prediction. Quantitative evidence from this segment shows very low intent to use other investments for retirement (8%), and moderate agreement with proactive financial attitudes (e.g., 41% only save for a purpose, 53% trust comparison sites, 34% think switching utilities is worth it). These suggest a somewhat lower-than-average sense of financial agency, but the V4 correction already accounts for this. No strong evidence to further lower the baseline. Therefore, I use the V4 corrected template for this concept and segment. Confidence is moderate-high due to direct relevance of the evidence and strong cross-class calibration.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'). V4 baseline for this concept is 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 18% neither, 13% slightly disagree, 9% strongly disagree (60% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3 due to prior over-prediction. The segment (Not Private Households) is typically lower-income, less stable, and less likely to have strong financial planning behaviors, but the demographic calibration for low income is now only +4pp (down from +8pp in V3). However, the quantitative evidence shows very low engagement with retirement investments (only 8% plan to use other investments for retirement), and moderate agreement with financial attitudes (e.g., 41% only save for a specific purpose, 34% think switching utilities is worth the effort). This suggests a lower sense of personal agency and responsibility for retirement than the general population. However, the V4 correction already accounts for over-prediction, and the concept is not as over-predicted as 'healthy eating' or 'environmental sustainability.' Therefore, I retain the V4 baseline for this concept (60% agreement), with no further downward adjustment, as the evidence is not strong enough to justify a further reduction. Confidence is moderate-high due to alignment with both the V4 template and the segment's quantitative profile.
Run 5: Strongly agree=23.00%, Slightly agree=33.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=15.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'). V4 baseline for this concept is 25% SA, 35% A, 18% N, 13% D, 9% SD (60% agreement), but for 'Not Private Households' (a highly constrained, often transient or institutionalized segment), agreement is likely lower. Quantitative evidence shows very low intent to use other investments for retirement (8%), and moderate-to-low engagement with proactive financial behaviors (e.g., only 34% agree switching utilities is worth the effort, 41% only save for a specific purpose). This suggests lower personal agency and less sense of individual responsibility for retirement. Therefore, I reduce agreement by 4pp (to 56%), distributing the difference mainly to 'neither' and 'slightly disagree'. This yields: SA 23%, A 33%, N 20%, D 15%, SD 9%. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative anchors and clear segment profile.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for the attitude 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 baseline for attitudes, which is appropriate given the lack of direct evidence about switching behavior or attitudes in the provided data. The quantitative evidence (moderate outgoings on utilities and council tax) supports the assumption of moderate engagement but does not indicate a need to adjust the baseline. There is no qualitative evidence suggesting a strong deviation from the baseline. The repeated application of the same distribution across runs, with clear reasoning and no contradictory evidence, further supports the robustness of the estimate. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 baseline for attitudes is used: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. This segment ('Not Private Households') shows moderate engagement with utilities (high outgoings on council tax/utilities, but no evidence of high switching behavior or strong consumer agency). There is no direct quantitative evidence of high agreement or disagreement, so the baseline is appropriate. No demographic calibration is applied, as this segment is not affluent or highly engaged. The final distribution is slightly weighted toward neutrality and mild disagreement, reflecting likely inertia and lower perceived benefit of switching in this group. Confidence is high due to well-calibrated baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 baseline for this is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about attitudes toward switching utilities in the provided data, but the segment ('Not Private Households') shows moderate outgoings on utilities and housing, which could indicate some awareness of utility costs but not necessarily a strong motivation to switch. No qualitative evidence suggests unusually high or low engagement with switching. Therefore, the general V4 baseline is appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed, as this segment does not trigger a strong adjustment. Confidence is high due to the well-calibrated baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude item. V4 baseline for 'Switching utilities worth effort' is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement), which is well-calibrated and should not be adjusted. The segment 'Not Private Households' shows moderate engagement with utilities (high outgoings on council tax/utilities, but no evidence of high switching or engagement). Quantitative evidence does not suggest higher or lower agreement than baseline. No qualitative evidence indicates a strong deviation. Therefore, the general V4 baseline is applied. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 baseline for this item is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. This matches the well-calibrated V3 template, which V4 retains unchanged due to minimal error in prior rounds (|error| < 3pp). Quantitative evidence shows this segment (Not Private Households) has moderate outgoings on utilities and housing, but there is no evidence of unusually high engagement or friction with utilities switching. No demographic calibration is needed, as this segment does not trigger high or low income/age adjustments. Qualitative context is minimal and does not suggest deviation from baseline. Therefore, the standard V4 attitude template for this concept is applied. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with evidence and prior calibration.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the standard attitude template: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. The segment 'Not Private Households' shows moderate engagement with practical matters (e.g., council tax, utilities), but there is no evidence of unusually high or low motivation to switch suppliers. Quantitative evidence (spending on utilities, council tax) is present but does not indicate above-average friction or enthusiasm. No demographic calibration is needed, as this segment does not trigger high/low income or age adjustments. Therefore, the standard V4 attitude baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative context and strong template fit.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.80
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the quantitative toplines, which show relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks, pet care) and higher rates for less frequent, higher-value purchases (home appliances, holidays/travel). This supports the inference of a mixed digital engagement profile, which is appropriately mapped to the V4 baseline for cash preference. The qualitative context (Not Private Households) is acknowledged as heterogeneous, and the decision not to apply demographic calibration is well-supported. The repeated use of the V4 baseline is justified by both the evidence and the protocol's guidance against over-calibration for this segment. Confidence is high due to the alignment between the evidence and the estimate.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 24.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting moderate agreement and a broad spread. Quantitative evidence from this segment (Not Private Households) shows relatively low online purchase rates for categories like alcoholic drinks (25%) and pet care (31%), but higher for home appliances (53%) and holiday/travel (66%). This suggests a mixed digital engagement profile, but not a strong digital preference. There is no direct evidence of cash preference, but the moderate online rates for everyday items (alcohol, pet care) suggest that cash use may be somewhat above average, but not dramatically so. No demographic calibration is applied, as this segment is not strongly associated with cash preference. Therefore, the V4 baseline is used without adjustment. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong relevance of online purchase data as a proxy for digital/cash preference.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For V4, the general baseline for this attitude is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), which already incorporates a -3pp correction due to V3's mild over-prediction for this item. Quantitative evidence from the segment (Not Private Households) shows relatively low online purchase rates for Alcoholic drinks (25%) and Pet care (31%), but higher for Home appliances (53%) and Holiday/travel (66%). This suggests a mixed digital adoption profile, but for everyday purchases (like alcohol, pet care), online is less common, implying a moderate preference for cash may persist. No strong evidence for a major deviation from the V4 baseline. No demographic calibration is applied, as Not Private Households is a heterogeneous group (students, communal living, etc.) and does not fit a clear high/low income or age profile. Therefore, the V4 baseline is used without further adjustment. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative proxies and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude'. V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting moderate agreement and a broad spread. Quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for this segment (e.g., only 25% for alcohol, 31% for pet care, 53% for home appliances, 66% for travel), suggesting a below-average digital adoption. This supports the baseline or a slight upward adjustment, but V4 guidance is to avoid over-calibration for this concept (low cross-class consistency). No strong qualitative evidence to override. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate for this segment. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative alignment and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For V4, the general baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3 due to low but present over-prediction bias. 

The quantitative evidence for 'Not Private Households' shows relatively low online purchase rates for Alcoholic drinks (25%) and Pet care (31%), but higher for Home appliances (53%) and Holiday/travel (66%). This suggests that for everyday or lower-value items, online purchasing is less common, which may indicate a higher preference for cash or in-person transactions for these categories. However, the overall context of 'Not Private Households' (which includes communal, institutional, or non-traditional living arrangements) may also mean less autonomy or opportunity for cash use, but the evidence is not strong enough to warrant a major deviation from the V4 baseline. 

Given the lack of direct quantitative data on cash preference and the moderate online purchase rates, the V4 baseline is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is moderate-high due to the alignment of indirect evidence and the well-calibrated V4 baseline for this concept.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. The V4 baseline for this is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), already incorporating a -3pp correction for prior over-prediction. The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for this segment (e.g., 25% for alcohol, 31% for pet care, 53% for home appliances, 66% for holidays/travel), suggesting a lower digital adoption and a likely higher preference for cash than the UK average. However, the V4 protocol instructs not to over-calibrate for class unless the evidence is overwhelming, and the 'Not Private Households' segment is diverse (e.g., students, communal living, etc.), so the baseline is appropriate. No further demographic adjustment is warranted. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between the baseline and the segment's digital behavior profile.
