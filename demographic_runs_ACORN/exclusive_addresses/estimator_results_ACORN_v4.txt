### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.77
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale for each run correctly identifies that the quantitative evidence (country of birth, account management by phone) is not directly relevant to the attitudinal concept being measured. The qualitative note about affluence is acknowledged, but since the concept is generic and unspecified, there is no clear basis for demographic calibration or deviation from the V4 attitude baseline. The repeated use of the baseline is methodologically sound in the absence of more targeted evidence. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The segment is described as the most affluent in the population, but there is no direct evidence that would systematically shift attitudes up or down for a generic 'Concept' (since the concept is unspecified). Quantitative evidence is weak and not directly related to attitudinal agreement. Demographic calibration for high income would be +2pp, but since the concept is generic and no anchor is provided, the baseline is most appropriate. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The segment is described as the most affluent in the population, but the quantitative evidence provided (country of birth, account management by phone) is not directly relevant to the attitude concept and does not justify a demographic calibration. No concept-specific correction is indicated. Therefore, the general attitude baseline is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment with the V4 template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.75 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The segment is described as the most affluent in the population, but there is no direct evidence that affluence would systematically increase or decrease agreement for a generic attitude concept. The quantitative evidence provided (country of birth, account management by phone) is not directly relevant to the attitude concept, so no demographic calibration is applied. The qualitative note about affluence is noted, but without a clear link to the concept, it does not justify deviation from the baseline. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account by phone' at 17%, 'Arrange current account by phone' at 9%) is not directly related to the attitude concept, and the country of birth segments are very small proportions (1% Rest of Europe, 5% Other), so they do not warrant demographic calibration. The qualitative note indicates affluence and lack of financial concern, but as this is a general attitude item and not identity or high-friction behavior, no further upward adjustment is justified. Therefore, the general attitude baseline is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided is not directly related to the concept (it is about country of birth and current account management by phone), and the qualitative note only indicates affluence but does not suggest a strong directional shift for a generic attitude item. No concept-specific correction is indicated. Demographic calibration for affluence would be +2pp, but since the concept is generic and no clear direction is given, the baseline is retained. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence: only 9% of the segment consider themselves environmentalists and 22% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating low environmental engagement. The qualitative note about affluence is considered but not over-weighted, as there is no evidence that affluence increases pro-environmental attitudes in this context. The use of the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, given the systematic over-prediction in previous versions and the lack of evidence for higher agreement. The one run that slightly lowers agreement (Run 4) is well-justified by the quantitative evidence. Overall, the approach is methodologically sound, and confidence is high due to strong alignment with the provided evidence.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 7.80%
  Slightly agree: 21.40%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.40%
  Slightly disagree: 23.40%
  Strongly disagree: 17.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), reflecting a -15pp correction for systematic over-prediction. Segment quantitative evidence shows only 9% consider themselves environmentalists and 22% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating low environmental engagement even among this affluent segment. No evidence suggests higher agreement than baseline. Qualitative notes confirm affluence but do not indicate stronger environmental attitudes. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, with no upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 cross-class analysis shows this item is systematically over-predicted, so the corrected baseline is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). Segment quantitative evidence shows only 9% consider themselves environmentalists and 22% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating low environmental engagement even among this affluent segment. No evidence suggests higher agreement than the V4 baseline. Qualitative notes confirm affluence but do not indicate stronger environmental attitudes. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events. V4 cross-class analysis shows this concept is systematically over-predicted, so the corrected baseline is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this affluent segment shows only 9% consider themselves environmentalists and 22% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating low environmental engagement. No evidence suggests this group is more pro-environment than the general population, so no upward demographic calibration is warranted. The qualitative note confirms affluence but does not indicate higher environmental concern. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=19.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events'). V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), due to systematic over-prediction in V3 and high cross-class consistency error. 

Segment quantitative evidence shows very low environmental self-identity (only 9% consider themselves environmentalists) and low trust in energy companies' environmental care (22%). This suggests even lower agreement than the already-lowered V4 baseline. The segment is described as 'the most affluent in the population, who have no financial concerns,' which may slightly increase agreement, but the quantitative evidence is strongly weighted and overrides this. 

Therefore, I reduce agreement by 1-3pp from the V4 baseline, resulting in: 7% strongly agree, 19% slightly agree, 32% neither, 25% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree. This is a conservative estimate, reflecting both the low quantitative values and the affluent profile, with high confidence due to strong direct evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events. The V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3 and cross-class consistency. Segment quantitative evidence shows only 9% consider themselves environmentalists and 22% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both low for this affluent segment. There is no evidence of unusually high pro-environmental attitudes in this group, and affluence does not correlate with higher agreement on this item in the data. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied without upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class correction.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the V4 baseline calibration for this attitude, which is supported by the absence of strong contradictory evidence in the provided quantitative and qualitative data. The segment's high income and high outgoings on housing/utilities are noted, but these do not provide a compelling reason to adjust the well-calibrated baseline. The evidence selection is balanced, and the decision to maintain the baseline is well-supported by both the calibration guidance and the segment profile. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.00%
  Slightly agree: 40.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 15.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ("make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home"). V4 baseline for this item is well-calibrated (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%) and should be kept unchanged. The segment is 'exclusive addresses'—the highest income, most valuable homes, directors/managers, high savings. There is no direct quantitative evidence for this specific item, but the segment's high income and home value could suggest less price sensitivity, potentially lowering motivation to cut down. However, V4 guidance is to keep the well-calibrated baseline unless strong evidence suggests otherwise. No evidence here is strong enough to override the baseline. Therefore, the standard V4 distribution is applied. Confidence is high due to strong calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' type, but for 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', V4 identifies this as a well-calibrated item (no systematic error, so keep V3 values). The segment is affluent (highest income, valuable homes, directors/managers), but there is no strong evidence that affluence increases or decreases agreement for this specific attitude—prior data shows this item is not highly sensitive to income. Quantitative evidence from the segment (e.g., high outgoings on housing/utilities) does not contradict the baseline. Therefore, use the V3/V4 baseline: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a low-friction behavior (easy, everyday action). According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the baseline: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment is 'exclusive addresses'—the highest income, most valuable homes, directors/managers, with high savings. There is no direct quantitative evidence for this specific item, but the segment's high affluence and likely environmental awareness (common in affluent, educated groups) do not warrant a downward or upward demographic calibration (V4 demographic adjustments are now minimal, and this segment is already well-calibrated). No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the V4 baseline. Confidence is high due to the strong cross-class calibration for this concept.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home'), and V4 guidance indicates this is a well-calibrated concept (V3 error -2.6pp), so the baseline should be kept: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment is 'exclusive addresses'—the highest income, most valuable homes, directors/managers, high savings. While high income sometimes reduces friction for energy-saving behaviors, this is an attitude (not high-friction behavior), and affluent segments often express pro-efficiency attitudes, especially with high bills (outgoings on housing/utilities are high at £223/wk). No evidence suggests a need to adjust the baseline up or down. Quantitative evidence is limited but does not contradict the baseline. Therefore, the well-calibrated V4 baseline is applied without demographic adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with V4 calibration and segment profile.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a 'Behavior (Low Friction)' but is treated as a well-calibrated concept in V4 (see prompt: 'Cut down gas/electricity at home' - KEEP V3: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%). The segment is 'exclusive addresses'—the highest income, most valuable homes, directors/managers, high savings. There is no direct quantitative evidence for this specific behavior, but the segment's high income and home value suggest they may have both the means and the incentive (due to large homes and high bills) to care about energy use, but also may be less price-sensitive. However, V4 instructs to keep the well-calibrated baseline unchanged, and demographic calibration for high income is only +2pp, which is within the margin of error. Therefore, the baseline V4 distribution is applied. Confidence is high due to direct mapping to a well-calibrated concept and strong segment definition.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the evidence hierarchy, giving primacy to the most relevant quantitative anchor ('Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 49%), but correctly notes that this is a broader and more positively framed item than the stricter 'fuel consumption is the most important feature.' The V4 cross-class correction and segment-specific context (affluent, no financial concerns) are appropriately used to justify a lower agreement rate, and the qualitative evidence is integrated to support the lack of upward demographic adjustment. The repeated use of the V4 corrected baseline is methodologically sound given the evidence and the segment profile. Confidence is high due to the clear, consistent application of evidence and correction logic.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.20%
  Slightly agree: 13.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 23.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about fuel consumption being the most important feature when buying a new car. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 49%, but this is a broader and more positive framing than the much narrower and more exclusive 'fuel consumption is the most important feature.' V4 cross-class analysis shows systematic over-prediction for this concept, so the corrected baseline is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The segment is affluent, which would normally merit a +2pp calibration, but V4 reduces demographic adjustments by 50%, so the effect is minimal and does not shift the distribution meaningfully. The qualitative note ('no financial concerns') suggests that fuel economy is less likely to be prioritized as 'most important' by this group. The evidence hierarchy is led by the quantitative anchor (49% for environmental/CO2 importance), but the concept-specific correction and segment context both point to a lower agreement rate. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied without upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchoring and clear cross-class correction guidance.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the V4 prompt specifies a concept-specific correction: for 'Fuel consumption important when buying car', reduce by -5pp from the V3 high-friction baseline. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action: 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.49), which is higher than the V4 baseline for this concept (15% agreement), but the segment is 'the most affluent in the population', who may care about environmental issues but are less price-sensitive and more likely to prioritize other features (luxury, performance, brand). The qualitative note supports this: 'no financial concerns', so fuel economy is less likely to be the top priority. Therefore, I use the V4 concept-specific baseline (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%) and do not apply a positive demographic calibration, as affluence likely reduces the importance of fuel consumption as the most important feature. The evidence hierarchy is respected: direct quant (0.49) is considered, but the concept asks about 'most important', which is stricter than 'important'. Confidence is high due to strong concept-specific calibration and supporting evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=17.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=19.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about fuel consumption being the most important feature when buying a new car. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the 'Action | Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low co2 emissions' (value=0.49), which is a related but not identical concept. The V4 baseline for this concept type is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3. The segment is the most affluent, who are less likely to prioritize cost-saving features like fuel consumption as their top priority, but may care about environmental impact. The 0.49 value for environmental friendliness is higher than the general baseline, but not a majority. Given the segment's affluence and the evidence, a slight upward adjustment is justified, but not enough to shift the overall agreement above 21%. Therefore, I allocate: SA 4%, A 17%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 19%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear segment profile.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the context and evidence suggest it is a high-friction behavioral attitude for this affluent segment. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 49%, but this is a broader and more positively framed item than 'fuel consumption is the most important feature.' V4's cross-class correction for this concept is to REDUCE by -5pp from V3, yielding a baseline of 15% agreement (3% strongly agree, 12% slightly agree). The affluent segment may be more likely to consider environmental/fuel factors, but for this group, luxury, performance, and brand are often more important than fuel economy, so no positive demographic calibration is applied. The qualitative note ('no financial concerns') further supports that fuel economy is less likely to be prioritized. Therefore, the V4 corrected distribution is used, with no upward adjustment. The evidence hierarchy is led by the direct quantitative anchor (49%), but the concept-specific correction and segment context override, resulting in a low agreement estimate.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the context and evidence suggest it is a relatively low-priority attitude for this affluent segment. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 49%, but this is a broader and more positive framing than 'fuel consumption is the most important feature.' V4's cross-class correction for this concept is to REDUCE by -5pp from the high-friction behavior baseline, yielding a low agreement (15% total agree: 3% strongly, 12% slightly). The affluent segment is less price-sensitive and less likely to prioritize fuel economy above all else, so the 'most important' framing further reduces agreement. The qualitative note reinforces that this group has 'no financial concerns,' supporting a lower agreement. The distribution maintains high neutrality and disagreement, as per V4's corrected template for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchoring and clear segment fit.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified based on the evidence provided. The rationale consistently references the V4 attitude baseline, which is described as well-calibrated for this concept, and notes that there is no direct quantitative evidence to warrant deviation from this baseline. The related quantitative toplines (risk-taking, community involvement, climate concern) are considered, but are not directly indicative of debt aversion, and the qualitative demographic context (affluent, urban) is not shown to systematically affect this attitude in prior analyses. The repeated use of the V4 template is appropriate given the lack of contradictory or directly relevant evidence. Confidence is high due to the strong fit with the template and the absence of evidence suggesting a need for adjustment. No corrective feedback is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), so the V4 attitude baseline applies: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about debt aversion, but the segment's low 'helping out in the community' (0.11), moderate climate concern (0.27), and moderate risk tolerance (0.38) suggest a somewhat individualistic, possibly affluent, urban profile. However, none of these directly indicate a strong deviation from the general population's attitude toward debt. The V4 baseline for this concept is already well-calibrated (43% agreement), and there is no evidence to justify a demographic calibration (affluent/urban classes do not systematically differ on this item in V3/V4 analysis). Therefore, I use the V4 attitude template unchanged. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), so the V4 baseline for attitudes is used (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). However, the segment's quantitative toplines show relatively low agreement with other pro-social or risk-averse attitudes (e.g., only 11% help out in the community, 27% see climate change as a major threat, 38% are willing to take risks with money). These suggest a somewhat more individualistic, possibly risk-tolerant profile, but not dramatically so. The baseline for this concept is already well-calibrated (V3 error -0.2pp), so no further adjustment is needed. Demographic hints (central London/South East, likely affluent) do not strongly shift the prediction for this attitude. Therefore, the well-calibrated V4 baseline is used: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and the concept's calibration history.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), so the V4 baseline for attitudes is used: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, the segment's quantitative toplines show relatively low agreement with other pro-social or risk-averse attitudes (e.g., only 27% agree climate change is the biggest threat, 11% help out in the community, 38% are risk-tolerant with money). This suggests a moderate, not high, aversion to debt. The segment is described as living in affluent London/South East areas, which may slightly increase the proportion who dislike debt, but not dramatically. The V4 baseline for this concept is already well-calibrated and should not be adjusted. Therefore, I retain the V4 attitude template for this concept. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude item. According to V4, this is a well-calibrated concept, so the baseline template (SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%) should be used without adjustment. The quantitative evidence provided does not directly address debt attitudes, but related items (risk-taking with money at 0.38, helping out in the community at 0.11, climate concern at 0.27) suggest a moderate-to-low agreement with risk and community orientation, which does not warrant deviation from the baseline. The qualitative note about central London/South East suburbs does not indicate a strong demographic skew that would justify calibration. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct match with a well-calibrated template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude item. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the standard template: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided does not directly address debt aversion, but related attitudes (risk-taking with money at 38%, climate concern at 27%) suggest a moderate-to-low risk aversion profile, which could slightly lower debt aversion, but not enough to override the well-calibrated baseline. The segment is described as affluent, central London/South East, which may slightly reduce debt aversion, but demographic calibrations are minimal in V4. Therefore, the standard distribution is retained. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.80
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I am very good at managing money' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence and the methodological approach. The rationale consistently applies the V4 identity baseline, which is already corrected for known over-prediction, and carefully considers the indirect quantitative evidence (moderate online savings management, high car ownership, high miscellaneous spending) without over-interpreting it. The qualitative note does not contradict the estimate. The lack of direct evidence for or against strong money management is acknowledged, and the decision not to further calibrate is reasonable. Confidence is high due to the strong alignment with the V4 template and the absence of contradictory evidence. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 34.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%

  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is classified as an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity items is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, for this specific concept, V4 applies a moderate correction (-6pp from V3) due to consistent over-prediction, resulting in SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). The quantitative evidence does not directly address money management skill, but the segment's high online banking usage (38%) and high private car ownership (80%) suggest financial engagement and some affluence, supporting the baseline. No evidence suggests a need for further adjustment. Confidence is moderate-high due to alignment with V4 calibration and indirect support from segment data.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is classified as an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity concepts is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, the concept-specific correction for 'good at managing money' is to reduce agreement by 6pp due to consistent over-prediction in V3, resulting in SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). 

The quantitative evidence is limited but does not contradict this: 38% manage savings online (suggesting moderate financial engagement), and high miscellaneous spending could indicate either comfort with money or lack of control, but no direct evidence of poor money management. The qualitative note does not directly address money management. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. 

Therefore, the V4 corrected identity template for this concept is applied directly, with high confidence due to the strong cross-class evidence base.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an identity statement ('I am very good at managing money'). V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), already incorporating a -6pp correction for prior over-prediction. Quantitative evidence is limited but relevant: 38% manage savings online (moderate digital engagement), and high outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services suggest some discretionary spending. However, there is no direct evidence of poor money management, and the segment is not flagged as financially constrained. Qualitative context does not indicate financial stress. Therefore, the V4 identity baseline is appropriate, with no further demographic calibration needed. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the corrected template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for this concept is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), which is already adjusted down by 6pp from V3 due to moderate over-prediction. The quantitative evidence does not directly address money management skill, but the segment shows moderate online savings account management (38%), which is slightly below average, and high private car ownership (80%), suggesting affluence but not necessarily financial skill. There is no evidence of financial distress or exceptional financial acumen. The qualitative note does not directly address money management. Therefore, the general V4 baseline for this identity concept is appropriate, with no further demographic or evidence-based adjustment needed. Confidence is high due to the strong alignment with the V4 template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an identity statement ('I am very good at managing money'), so the V4 identity baseline is used: SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the moderate rate of managing savings accounts online (38%), which is slightly below the UK average, suggesting moderate financial engagement but not exceptional. There is no evidence of financial distress or high friction, and the segment's high outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services (123.56) may indicate disposable income but not necessarily strong money management skills. No qualitative evidence directly addresses money management ability. Therefore, the V4 identity baseline is applied with a slight upward nudge to 'neither' and a slight reduction to 'slightly agree' to reflect moderate but not exceptional financial engagement. No demographic calibration is applied as there is no strong evidence of high or low income. Confidence is moderate-high due to the identity nature of the item and the presence of moderately relevant quantitative evidence.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the direct quantitative evidence (low agreement with similar 'practical' or 'responsibility' attitudes, e.g., fuel consumption importance at 13%) and the well-calibrated status of the insurance attitude concept in the V4/V3 baseline. The qualitative note (moderate internet usage) is correctly identified as not relevant to insurance attitudes. No evidence suggests the segment is unusually risk-averse or insurance-focused, so no demographic or context-specific adjustment is warranted. The repeated use of the V4 baseline is appropriate, and the confidence in the estimate is well-supported by the evidence provided. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement: 'It is important to be well insured for everything.' According to V4, this is a well-calibrated concept (error <3pp), so we use the baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The provided quantitative evidence for a similar 'practical' attitude (fuel consumption as most important car feature, 13%) is low, supporting a low agreement estimate. No evidence suggests this segment is unusually risk-averse or insurance-focused. The qualitative note (moderate internet usage) does not affect insurance attitudes. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, and no demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative support and strong V4 calibration for this concept.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is an attitude item. According to V4, this is a well-calibrated concept (error <3pp in V3), so we use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The provided quantitative evidence shows low agreement with other 'responsibility' or 'importance' attitudes (e.g., only 13% agree that fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car), suggesting a generally low tendency to strongly agree with such statements in this segment. No evidence suggests a need for demographic calibration. The qualitative note on moderate internet usage does not affect insurance attitudes. Therefore, the baseline is appropriate and supported by the evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is an attitude item. According to the V4 prompt, this concept is among those that are well-calibrated in V3 and should not be adjusted. The V3/V4 baseline for this item is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The provided segment's quantitative toplines show low agreement with other 'responsibility' or 'importance' attitudes (e.g., only 13% agree that fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car), which supports a low agreement estimate for insurance importance as well. There is no evidence in the qualitative notes to suggest this segment is unusually risk-averse or insurance-focused. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate and supported by the segment's generally low agreement with similar 'importance' attitudes. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and strong cross-class calibration.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is an attitude item. According to the V4 prompt, this specific concept is well-calibrated in V3 and should be kept unchanged: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence for this segment shows low agreement with other 'responsibility' or 'practicality' attitudes (e.g., only 13% agree that fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car), suggesting a pragmatic but not highly risk-averse or security-focused profile. There is no evidence of unusually high concern for insurance or risk. Therefore, the V4 baseline for this concept is appropriate, and no demographic or context-specific adjustment is warranted. Confidence is high due to direct alignment with the evidence and the well-calibrated status of this concept in the model.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is an attitude item. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The provided quantitative evidence for a similar attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', value=0.13) is low, suggesting this segment is less likely to strongly prioritize practical/financial caution traits. There is no direct evidence suggesting higher agreement with insurance importance. The qualitative note ('Internet usage: Moderate') does not indicate a strong bias toward or against insurance attitudes. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, and no demographic or concept-specific adjustment is needed. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and a well-calibrated baseline.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes in the affluent 'exclusive addresses' segment is well justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 cross-class correction for systematic over-prediction, and the quantitative evidence (very low vegan/vegetarian rates, majority meat-eaters, significant pescatarian/flexitarian/other) supports the conclusion that this segment is not dramatically more health-focused in dietary practice than the general population. The qualitative note about affluence is considered but not over-weighted, as the quantitative data does not show a strong deviation. The decision not to apply further demographic uplift is appropriate. Confidence is high due to the clear alignment between the evidence and the estimate. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.20%
  Slightly agree: 25.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude), which V4 identifies as systematically over-predicted in all classes and corrects by -22pp from V3. The segment is 'exclusive addresses'—the most affluent, with no financial concerns. Quantitative data shows only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, 51% meat-eaters, and 49% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, indicating a strong preference for traditional diets but also a significant openness to alternatives. However, 'Healthy Eating' as an attitude is not the same as actual dietary restriction; affluent segments may value healthy eating as a concept even if not strictly vegan/vegetarian. V4's cross-class correction for 'Healthy Eating' is to use: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14% (38% agreement), which is applied here. No further demographic uplift is applied, as the affluent segment does not show a strong enough deviation in the quantitative data to warrant it. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class evidence and relevant quantitative context.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is 12% SA, 26% A, 26% N, 22% D, 14% SD (38% agreement), reflecting a major -22pp correction due to systematic over-prediction in V3. Quantitative evidence shows this affluent segment is not especially likely to be vegan (1%) or vegetarian (4%), with a majority eating meat (51%) and nearly half identifying as pescatarian/flexitarian/other (49%). This suggests a moderate but not high prevalence of healthy eating attitudes—likely higher than the general population, but not dramatically so. The qualitative note ('most affluent, no financial concerns') may slightly increase health awareness, but not enough to override the strong quantitative evidence of typical meat consumption. Therefore, I use the V4 corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes, with a slight +1pp to SA (13%) to reflect possible affluence-driven health consciousness, but otherwise keep the distribution as per the V4 correction. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear V4 guidance.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an affluent segment, but the quantitative data shows only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 49% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 51% eating meat. This suggests that while there may be some openness to alternative diets, the majority are not strongly committed to restrictive healthy eating patterns. The concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, and V4 requires a -22pp correction due to systematic over-prediction in prior versions. The affluent context might slightly increase agreement, but the quantitative evidence does not support a major upward adjustment. Therefore, I use the V4 corrected template for 'Healthy Eating' (SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%), with no further demographic uplift. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear cross-class correction guidance.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is now 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). Quantitative evidence shows this affluent segment is not especially likely to be vegan (1%) or vegetarian (4%), with a majority eating meat (51%) and a large pescatarian/flexitarian/other group (49%). This suggests a moderate openness to dietary variety but not a strong shift toward 'healthy' eating as defined by plant-based diets. The qualitative note confirms affluence but does not indicate a health focus. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, with no upward demographic calibration (affluence does not strongly predict higher agreement for 'healthy eating' in the data). Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and the V4 cross-class correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: This is an affluent segment ("the most affluent in the population, who have no financial concerns and live in the most expensive"), but the quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 49% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 51% eating meat. This suggests that while there may be some openness to alternative diets, the majority are not strictly following what is typically considered 'healthy eating' (e.g., plant-based or restricted diets). The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is used, which is 12% strongly agree, 26% slightly agree, 26% neither, 22% slightly disagree, 14% strongly disagree (total agreement 38%). The quantitative data supports a moderate, not high, level of agreement with healthy eating attitudes, and the affluent context does not override the general pattern. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear V4 correction for this concept.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for agreement with 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the V4 baseline (60% agreement: 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree), which is well-calibrated for this attitude item. The segment ('most affluent, no financial concerns') would typically nudge agreement slightly higher, but the V4 demographic calibration for high income is now only +2pp, already incorporated in the baseline. The available quantitative evidence ('plans to use other investments for retirement' at 15%) is not directly about the attitude but does not contradict it, and the qualitative note supports a high sense of self-reliance. The runs correctly avoid over-interpreting weakly related evidence and do not apply unwarranted demographic adjustments. Confidence is high due to strong template calibration and segment fit. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.00%
  Slightly disagree: 13.00%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'). V4 baseline for this concept is 60% agreement (25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree), based on cross-class calibration and moderate over-prediction in V3. The segment is 'the most affluent in the population, who have no financial concerns.' While affluence might slightly increase agreement, V4 demographic calibration for high income is now only +2pp, so the baseline is essentially unchanged. No direct quantitative evidence for this exact statement, but related attitudes (e.g., 'plans to use other investments for retirement' at 15%) suggest a strong sense of self-reliance, supporting the baseline. Other attitudes (e.g., 'switching utilities worth the effort' at 27%) are not directly relevant. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, with a slight upward nudge for affluence, but within rounding error. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and segment fit.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'). V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3 due to mild over-prediction (+3pp previously). The segment is 'the most affluent in the population, who have no financial concerns', which would typically nudge agreement slightly higher, but V4 demographic calibrations are now halved (+2pp for high income). However, the most relevant quantitative anchor ('Plans to use other investments for retirement', 15%) is low, but this is a behavior, not an attitude, and does not directly contradict the attitude of personal responsibility. The other attitudes ('I only save for a specific purpose', 39%; 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort', 27%) are not directly relevant. Therefore, the V4 baseline is most appropriate, with only a minimal demographic adjustment (which is already included in the V4 baseline for this concept). Confidence is high due to strong alignment with V4 calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is an attitude item. V4 baseline for this concept is 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 18% neither, 13% slightly disagree, 9% strongly disagree (60% agreement). The segment is 'the most affluent in the population, who have no financial concerns.' While this group may be more likely to agree with self-reliance, the V4 demographic calibration for high income is now only +2pp (down from +5pp in V3). However, the provided quantitative evidence is not directly about responsibility for retirement, but about using other investments (15%) and saving for specific purposes (39%), both of which suggest a degree of planning but not overwhelming. The qualitative note supports a higher sense of self-reliance, but not enough to override the V4 baseline. Therefore, I retain the V4 baseline for this concept (60% agreement), with only a minimal upward nudge (+2pp) for affluence, but this is already incorporated in the V4 template. Confidence is high due to strong template calibration and segment fit.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is an attitude item. According to V4, the baseline for this concept is 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 18% neither, 13% slightly disagree, and 9% strongly disagree (60% agreement). The segment is 'exclusive addresses'—the most affluent, with no financial concerns. While this group may be more likely to feel empowered and responsible for their own retirement, the quantitative evidence for related attitudes (e.g., 'plans to use other investments for retirement' at 15%) suggests that while they may agree with the principle, their actual behavior may not always align. However, the V4 demographic calibration for high income is now only +2pp, so the baseline is only slightly increased. No direct quantitative evidence for this exact attitude is present, but the context supports a modestly above-average agreement. Therefore, I retain the V4 baseline with a slight upward nudge, but not enough to justify a full demographic adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between concept type, segment, and available evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is used: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). This is a well-calibrated concept with only a minor V4 correction (-3pp from V3). The segment is 'the most affluent in the population, who have no financial concerns,' which would normally suggest a slight upward calibration, but V4 demographic adjustments are now halved (+2pp for high income). However, the V4 protocol says to only apply this if the evidence is ambiguous or the baseline is not already well-calibrated. Here, the baseline is already high (60% agreement), and the evidence does not directly contradict this. Quantitative evidence is not directly about retirement responsibility, but the low value for 'plans to use other investments for retirement' (15%) suggests most do not expect to rely on alternatives, which is consistent with a sense of personal responsibility. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, with no further upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between concept, segment, and evidence.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references both the quantitative evidence (high outgoings on utilities, affluence) and the qualitative note (no financial concerns), and correctly applies the V4 baseline for this attitude concept. The reasoning recognizes that affluence may reduce motivation to switch utilities, supporting the decision to retain the baseline without upward adjustment. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the calibration is well explained. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 attitude baseline applies: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The segment is the most affluent in the population, with no financial concerns and high outgoings on utilities (quantitative: £6,640/year on council tax, utilities, etc.). However, affluent segments are typically less price-sensitive and less motivated to switch for savings, as the effort may not be seen as worthwhile relative to their income. This is supported by the qualitative note ('no financial concerns'). Therefore, agreement is likely slightly below the general baseline. No strong evidence suggests a higher-than-average agreement. I have kept the V4 baseline for this attitude, with a minor tilt toward more disagreement (slightly higher 'slightly disagree' and 'neither'), reflecting affluent inertia. Confidence is high due to strong segment evidence and well-calibrated V4 baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'). V4 baseline for this attitude is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement), which is well-calibrated and should be kept as per the V4 prompt. The segment is 'the most affluent in the population, who have no financial concerns.' While affluence might slightly increase agreement (as they may be more aware of potential savings or more likely to value efficiency), the V4 demographic calibration for high income is now only +2pp, and the prompt says to keep well-calibrated concepts unchanged. Quantitative evidence about high outgoings on utilities (council tax, utilities, etc.) supports that this group has significant bills, but their lack of financial concern may reduce the perceived 'worth the effort' (since savings are less motivating). Therefore, the baseline is appropriate, with no strong reason to shift up or down. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with V4 calibration and evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 baseline is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. This matches the well-calibrated template for this item (error <3pp in V3), so no further correction is needed. Demographically, this segment is 'the most affluent in the population, who have no financial concerns.' While affluence could slightly increase agreement (as they may be more proactive or see higher potential savings), the V4 demographic calibration for high income is now only +2pp, which is not enough to shift the distribution out of the baseline band. Quantitative evidence (outgoings, affluence) does not directly indicate higher engagement with switching utilities, and affluent groups may be less price-sensitive or less motivated to switch. Therefore, the baseline template is appropriate, and no further adjustment is warranted. Confidence is high due to strong template calibration and clear demographic fit.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to the V4 prompt, this item is well-calibrated (V3 error: -2.1pp), so the baseline template is retained: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. The segment is described as the most affluent in the population, with no financial concerns and high outgoings on utilities (quantitative evidence: high council tax/utilities spend, £6640/year). However, affluence typically reduces the perceived benefit of switching for savings, as the effort may not be seen as worthwhile relative to potential gains. There is no strong evidence to increase agreement, so the general population baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with both the evidence hierarchy (quantitative and qualitative) and the V4 calibration for this concept.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. The V4 baseline for this attitude is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement), which is well-calibrated and does not require further adjustment. Quantitative evidence shows this segment is highly affluent, with high outgoings and no financial concerns, suggesting they may be less motivated to switch utilities for savings, but not strongly opposed. There is no evidence of systematic over- or under-prediction for this concept, so the general template is appropriate. The confidence is high due to strong quantitative support and alignment with the V4 calibration.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references both the quantitative toplines (moderate online purchase rates across categories) and the qualitative note ('Internet usage: Moderate'), both of which support the use of the V4 baseline for the cash preference attitude. There is no evidence of strong digital or cash dominance, and no demographic or class-specific correction is indicated. The repeated, consistent application of the V4 baseline, with explicit reference to the evidence, demonstrates methodological soundness. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between the evidence and the estimate.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 24.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting moderate agreement and a broad spread. Quantitative evidence shows moderate online purchase rates (alcohol 45%, pet care 33%, appliances 57%, travel 71%), suggesting this segment is not highly digital-first, but not cash-dominant either. Qualitative note ('Internet usage: Moderate') supports this. No strong demographic or class-specific correction is indicated. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, with moderate confidence due to strong quantitative alignment and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. V4 guidance for this concept is to use the corrected baseline: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate but not majority preference for cash. Quantitative evidence shows moderate online purchasing rates (e.g., 45% for alcohol, 33% for pet care, 57% for appliances, 71% for holidays), indicating this segment is neither highly digital nor highly cash-oriented. Qualitative notes confirm 'moderate' internet usage, supporting the idea that cash preference is present but not dominant. No strong demographic calibration is needed. The distribution maintains variance and aligns with V4's cross-class correction for this item. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between evidence and the V4 template.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. The V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate but not majority preference for cash. The quantitative evidence shows moderate online purchasing rates for this segment (e.g., 45% for alcohol, 33% for pet care, 57% for appliances, 71% for travel), suggesting they are not strongly digital-first but are not cash-dominant either. The qualitative note ('Internet usage: Moderate') supports this, indicating neither high nor low digital engagement. There is no evidence to suggest a strong deviation from the V4 baseline, so the default distribution is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and well-calibrated V4 baseline.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The item is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting moderate agreement and a broad spread. Quantitative evidence shows moderate online purchasing rates (0.45 for alcohol, 0.33 for pet care, 0.57 for appliances, 0.71 for travel), indicating this segment is neither highly digital nor highly cash-oriented. The qualitative note ('Internet usage: Moderate') supports this, suggesting a balanced preference between cash and digital. No strong demographic or class-specific correction is warranted. The V4 baseline is therefore appropriate, with no further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between evidence and baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. V4 baseline for this is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting moderate agreement and a wide spread. Quantitative evidence shows moderate online purchase rates (e.g., 45% for alcohol, 33% for pet care, 57% for appliances, 71% for travel), suggesting this segment is neither highly digital nor highly cash-oriented. Qualitative note of 'Internet usage: Moderate' supports this. No strong demographic or concept-specific correction is needed. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, with no further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence and alignment with the segment's moderate digital engagement.
