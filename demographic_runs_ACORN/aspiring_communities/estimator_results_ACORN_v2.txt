### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.62
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale correctly identifies that the only quantitative data available pertains to behaviors (such as managing or arranging accounts by phone and country of birth), which are not directly relevant to the attitudinal concept being estimated. The use of a conservative baseline for attitude items is appropriate in the absence of direct evidence, and the repeated rationale across runs demonstrates consistency and methodological caution. The confidence level is appropriately described as moderate due to the lack of direct evidence. No revision is needed unless more directly relevant evidence becomes available.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.60 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the conservative baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no strong quantitative evidence suggesting deviation from this baseline: the only available quantitative data relates to country of birth and phone banking behaviors, which are not directly relevant to a generic 'Concept' attitude item. No qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the baseline is used without demographic calibration. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative baseline template is applied: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no strong quantitative evidence indicating higher or lower agreement, and the available quantitative data (e.g., 'Manage current account by phone' at 11%) is not directly relevant to the attitude concept in question. No demographic calibration is warranted, as the evidence is weak and not directly related to the concept. No qualitative evidence is present to shift the baseline. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence and reliance on the conservative baseline.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.60 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the conservative baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about agreement with the target concept, only some weakly relevant behavioral data (e.g., managing/arranging accounts by phone, country of birth) with low values (2-11%), but these do not directly inform attitudes. No qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the baseline template is used without further adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.60 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative baseline template is applied: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about the target concept, only about behaviors (e.g., managing/arranging accounts by phone) and country of birth, all with low prevalence (2-11%). These low values suggest that agreement with most attitudinal statements in this segment is likely to be modest at best, but since the evidence is not directly about the target concept, the baseline is not further reduced. No demographic calibration is warranted, as the evidence does not indicate a strong deviation from the baseline. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the revised conservative baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no strong quantitative evidence indicating higher or lower agreement for this segment, and the only retrieved quantitative data relates to behaviors (e.g., managing accounts by phone) with low prevalence, which does not directly inform attitudes. No qualitative evidence is present to suggest deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the default attitude template is used without further adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.89
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The critic consistently anchors the prediction in the strongest available quantitative evidence: only 8% self-identify as environmentalists, and only 27% agree that energy companies do not care about the environment. These are both low, and the qualitative note further supports the idea that environmental concern is present but not salient or actionable for this group. The rationale for reducing agreement rates below the conservative attitude baseline is well-argued and consistently applied across runs. The distribution reflects the evidence hierarchy, with low agreement, a large neutral segment, and a tilt toward disagreement. The confidence is appropriately high given the strength and relevance of the evidence. No major revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 5.00%
  Slightly agree: 13.40%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.40%
  Slightly disagree: 29.60%
  Strongly disagree: 21.60%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events. Direct quantitative evidence shows only 8% consider themselves environmentalists (very low), and only 27% think energy companies don't care about the environment (low skepticism). Qualitative notes reinforce that while there is some care for the environment, this group is not willing to pay extra for environmentally friendly options, indicating low salience. According to the evidence hierarchy, the 8% figure is dominant and should anchor the prediction. The conservative attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%) is adjusted downward to reflect the very low direct agreement and qualitative apathy, resulting in a distribution with only 5% strongly agree and 13% slightly agree. The majority are neutral or disagreeing, with increased variance to avoid regression to the mean. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item, but direct quantitative evidence shows extremely low self-identification as 'environmentalist' (8%) and low agreement that energy companies care about the environment (27%). Qualitative notes reinforce that while there is some care, it does not translate into willingness to pay or strong attitudes. The baseline for attitude is already conservative (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%), but the direct evidence (8% agreement) justifies pushing agreement even lower. Therefore, I allocate only 5% to strongly agree and 13% to slightly agree, with a large portion in 'neither' and a tilt toward disagreement, reflecting both the quantitative and qualitative evidence. Confidence is high due to strong direct evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events. The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low agreement with 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (8%) and low agreement with 'energy companies do not care about the environment' (27%). Qualitative notes reinforce that while there is some care about the environment, this segment is not willing to pay extra or prioritize environmentalism. The baseline for attitude items is already conservative (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%), but the direct evidence here is much lower than even that. Therefore, I push the agreement rates down further, with only 18% total agreement (SA 5%, A 13%), and a majority in disagreement (D 32%, SD 22%), reflecting the segment's low environmental self-identification and lack of willingness to act on environmental values. Confidence is high due to strong, direct quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events. The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low agreement with 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (8%) and low agreement with 'energy companies do not care about the environment' (27%). The qualitative note reinforces that while there is some care about the environment, there is strong reluctance to pay extra or prioritize it. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%, but given the very low direct agreement on environmentalism, both agree categories are reduced substantially and disagreement is increased. No demographic lift is warranted. The result is a low overall agreement, with most respondents neutral or disagreeing. Confidence is high due to strong direct quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events. The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low agreement with 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (8%) and low agreement with 'energy companies do not care about the environment' (27%). Qualitative notes reinforce that while there is some care about the environment, this segment is not willing to pay extra for environmentally friendly options, indicating low salience of environmentalism. According to the evidence hierarchy, the direct quantitative data (8% agreement) should dominate, so the prediction should be much lower than the attitude baseline (which would be SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%). To increase variance and avoid over-prediction, I push agreement even lower: SA 5%, A 13%. The rest is distributed to higher neutrality and disagreement, reflecting both the weak environmental identity and the qualitative reluctance to pay extra. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence (very high outgoings on housing/utilities), which supports the salience of energy-saving behaviors for this segment. The qualitative note about planning and weekly grocery shopping further supports the plausibility of cost-consciousness and organized behavior, which aligns with efforts to cut down on energy use. The absence of a direct quantitative match for the exact behavior is acknowledged, and the use of a concept-specific correction (based on known under-prediction bias) is methodologically sound. No evidence contradicts the estimate, and the evidence hierarchy is respected. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 8.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-salience cost-conscious behavior. The segment (Aspiring Communities) shows high outgoings on housing/utilities (79.45), suggesting a strong incentive to economize. There is no direct quantitative match for this exact behavior, but the concept-specific correction for this item is to INCREASE by 21pp due to prior under-prediction. The qualitative note about planning and weekly grocery shopping supports a cost-conscious, organized lifestyle. No evidence suggests unusually low agreement. Therefore, I apply the concept-specific template: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative and qualitative alignment, though not a direct match.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-salience cost-conscious behavior. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the segment's very high outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels (79.45), suggesting this is a salient expense. There is no direct quantitative measure of energy-saving effort, but the qualitative note ('more likely to plan in advance and shop for groceries weekly') suggests a degree of planning and cost-consciousness. The baseline for this concept (per v2 corrections) is SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. There is no evidence to suggest a downward or upward adjustment is needed for this segment, as the qualitative and quantitative evidence are neutral to slightly supportive. No demographic calibration is applied. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative relevance and alignment with the concept-specific correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-friction behavior but with a known under-prediction bias (-21pp in v1). The segment (Aspiring Communities) shows high outgoings on housing/utilities (79.45), suggesting salience of energy costs. No direct quantitative match for this exact item, but the qualitative note ('plan in advance and shop for groceries weekly') implies cost-consciousness and planning, which aligns with energy-saving behaviors. According to the V2 corrective template for this concept, the recommended distribution is SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. No evidence suggests deviation from this correction, and the demographic profile does not warrant further adjustment. Confidence is high due to the strong concept-specific correction and supporting qualitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-friction behavior but, per V2 guidance, is known to be under-predicted (actual agreement is higher than baseline). The segment (Aspiring Communities) shows high outgoings on housing/utilities (79.45), suggesting salience of energy costs. No direct quantitative match for this exact item, but qualitative evidence ('plan in advance and shop for groceries weekly') suggests cost-consciousness and planning. The concept-specific correction for this item is to INCREASE by 21pp over baseline, using: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. This matches the template exactly, as there is no evidence to override it. Confidence is high due to strong segment fit and concept-specific correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is an attitude item. The segment (Aspiring Communities) shows high outgoings on housing/utilities (79.45), but very low agreement with other pro-social or digital attitudes (e.g., only 14% agree with 'I make an effort to support local businesses'). However, the concept-specific correction for this item is to INCREASE agreement by 21pp over the attitude baseline, as previous predictions under-estimated cost-consciousness. The qualitative note about planning and weekly grocery shopping suggests some practical, cost-aware behaviors. Therefore, I use the concept-specific template: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. This is supported by the evidence hierarchy: the direct quantitative for this exact item is missing, but the segment's high utility spend and planning habits support above-average agreement. Confidence is high due to the strong concept-specific correction and supporting qualitative evidence.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.91
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale clearly links the quantitative evidence (39% say environmentally friendly/low CO2 is important when buying a car) to the target concept, while correctly noting that 'most important' is a higher bar than 'important.' The qualitative evidence ('won't pay extra') is appropriately used to further suppress agreement. The application of a concept-specific correction (reduce by 30pp) is methodologically sound given prior over-prediction. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the final distribution (majority neutral/disagree, minority agree) is well supported by both quantitative and qualitative data. No additional evidence or adjustment is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 5.00%
  Slightly agree: 15.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 30.00%
  Strongly disagree: 22.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', but the specific item ('fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is closely related to the provided quantitative evidence: 39% say environmentally friendly/low CO2 is important when buying a car (action, relevance=0.98). However, this is not the same as fuel consumption being the most important feature—it's a higher bar. Qualitative notes reinforce that while the segment cares about the environment, they are not willing to pay extra for it, suggesting that fuel consumption is not prioritized above all else. The concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' is to REDUCE by 30pp due to prior over-prediction. Therefore, I use the adjusted template: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. This matches the evidence hierarchy: direct quantitative (39% for related but not identical concept), qualitative (won't pay extra), and the conservative correction. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence and clear qualitative support.
Run 2: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item, but the evidence shows low actual prioritization of environmental/fuel factors when buying a car in this segment (quantitative: 39% say environmentally friendly/low CO2 is important, but this is not the same as 'most important'; qualitative: 'won't pay extra' for green features). The closest direct quantitative evidence is 39% for 'important', but the target concept is 'most important', which is a higher bar. The V2 prompt instructs to use the concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' (SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%), which matches the evidence and corrects for prior over-prediction. No demographic upweighting is warranted for this segment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear qualitative support.
Run 3: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: 1. Concept type: This is an attitude item, but the specific concept ('fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is closely related to the provided quantitative evidence about environmental priorities when buying a car (0.39 agree), which is a proxy for fuel economy concern. 2. Quantitative evidence: The closest direct evidence is 39% agreement for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' being important when buying a car. This is a higher bar than fuel consumption, but both are cost/environmental features. However, the concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' is to REDUCE by 30pp due to systematic over-prediction, so the template is SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. 3. Qualitative evidence: The segment cares about the environment but is unwilling to pay extra for it, suggesting that even among those who care, few will prioritize fuel consumption above all else. 4. Demographic calibration: No strong demographic lift is warranted for this segment. 5. Evidence hierarchy: The 0.39 agreement is the strongest quantitative anchor, but the concept-specific correction and qualitative evidence both push the estimate lower. 6. Increased variance: The distribution is pushed away from the mean, with a majority disagreeing or neutral. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative and qualitative alignment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item, but the evidence shows low to moderate agreement with environmental priorities in car buying (0.39), and even lower agreement with related environmental attitudes (0.27) and insurance (0.11). The qualitative note ('won't pay extra') further suppresses agreement. The V2 template for this concept (fuel consumption importance) is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. This matches the evidence hierarchy: direct quantitative data (0.39) is the strongest, but is not high enough to justify a majority agreement. The qualitative evidence supports a higher neutral/disagree share. No demographic upweighting is justified. Confidence is high due to strong direct evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item, but the evidence shows low actual prioritization of environmental/fuel factors when buying a car in this segment. The most relevant quantitative topline is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low co2 emissions' at 39%, but this is for environmentalism, not fuel economy specifically, and is still below 40%. Qualitative notes reinforce that while there is environmental concern, it does not translate into willingness to pay or prioritize in purchase decisions. The concept-specific correction for 'Fuel consumption important when buying car' is to REDUCE by 30pp, using the template: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. No demographic lift is warranted for this segment. The evidence is strong and directly relevant, so confidence is high.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently applies a concept-specific correction based on known over-prediction bias, and the use of relevant quantitative proxies (risk-taking, community engagement, climate concern) is appropriate. The qualitative evidence about planning and weekly shopping is correctly interpreted as only weakly supportive of debt aversion and does not warrant an upward adjustment. The repeated application of the same template across runs is justified by the lack of direct evidence for debt aversion and the segment's generally low agreement with attitudinal statements. Confidence is high due to the use of validated corrections and appropriate weighting of evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The most relevant quantitative evidence is from the same segment (ACORN Aspiring Communities): only 10% help out in the community, 23% see climate change as the biggest threat, 20% don't mind taking risks with money. These all indicate relatively low levels of strong agreement with pro-social or risk-averse attitudes. The qualitative note ('plan in advance and shop for groceries weekly') suggests some planning, but not necessarily strong debt aversion. The concept-specific correction for this item is to use: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. This is lower than a generic attitude template, reflecting the +26pp over-prediction bias found for this item. No evidence suggests this segment is especially debt-averse, so no upward demographic calibration is applied. Confidence is moderate-high due to direct quantitative proxies and a strong concept-specific correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The segment (Aspiring Communities) shows low agreement with other pro-social and risk-averse attitudes: only 10% help out in the community, 23% see climate change as the biggest threat, and 20% are comfortable taking financial risks. These low agreement rates suggest a generally moderate-to-low tendency to endorse strong attitudinal statements. The concept-specific correction for this item is to use a lower baseline (SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%), reflecting the +26pp over-prediction bias found in V1. No direct quantitative evidence on debt aversion is present, so the concept-specific template is applied without further upward adjustment. Qualitative evidence about planning and weekly shopping suggests some caution, but not enough to override the low agreement pattern. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and a well-calibrated template.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The segment (Aspiring Communities) shows low agreement with risk-taking (20%), helping out in the community (10%), and climate concern (23%), all indicating a generally cautious, low-risk profile. However, the direct evidence for debt aversion is not present, so the concept-specific correction for 'don't like being in debt' is applied: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. This matches the revised template, which corrects for previous over-prediction (+26pp bias). Demographic or qualitative evidence does not suggest a major deviation from this baseline. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and a well-calibrated template.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The segment (Aspiring Communities) shows low agreement with other pro-social and risk-averse attitudes: only 10% help out in the community, 23% see climate change as a major threat, and 20% are comfortable taking financial risks. These low agreement rates suggest a generally moderate-to-low tendency to strongly endorse attitudinal statements. The concept-specific correction for this item is to use: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%, reflecting the known over-prediction bias (+26pp) for this concept. No direct quantitative evidence on debt aversion is present, so the concept-specific correction is applied without further upward adjustment. The qualitative note about planning and weekly grocery shopping suggests some cautiousness, but not enough to override the low quantitative agreement trend. Confidence is high due to strong weighting of quantitative proxies and the use of a validated concept-specific correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The segment (Aspiring Communities) shows low agreement with risk-taking (20%) and low community engagement (10%), suggesting a cautious, risk-averse profile. However, the direct quantitative evidence for debt aversion is not present, so the concept-specific correction for this item is applied: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. This matches the revised template for this concept, which corrects for previous over-prediction. No strong demographic lift or reduction is warranted based on the qualitative note (planning ahead, weekly shopping), which is consistent with moderate caution but not extreme. Confidence is high due to the use of a concept-specific correction and supporting evidence of risk aversion.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.76
Critic confidence: 0.92
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently applies a conservative baseline for attitude items and adjusts it downward based on moderate financial engagement (29% manage savings online), high miscellaneous spending (41.5%), and lack of direct evidence for strong money management confidence. The qualitative evidence is correctly assessed as weak. The repeated runs show stability in the estimate, and the adjustments are well-explained and proportional to the evidence. No major evidence is overlooked, and the logic avoids over-interpretation. The confidence is moderate-high, as stated, due to reliance on proxies rather than direct measures. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 9.20%
  Slightly agree: 23.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 32.00%
  Slightly disagree: 21.60%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=9.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an attitude item. The conservative baseline for attitudes is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows only 29% manage savings accounts online (suggesting moderate financial engagement), and only 5% are very worried about car theft (implying low financial anxiety). There is no direct evidence of high financial confidence. The segment spends a moderate amount on miscellaneous goods/services, but this does not directly indicate money management skill. Qualitative evidence is weak. Therefore, I slightly lower agreement from the baseline, increase neutrality, and keep disagreement slightly elevated. No strong demographic calibration applies. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: 1) Concept type: This is an attitude item, so the conservative baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. 2) Quantitative evidence: There is no direct measure of self-assessed money management skill, but only 29% manage savings online (suggesting moderate digital/financial engagement), and outgoings on miscellaneous goods are high (41.5%), which may indicate less disciplined spending. 3) Demographic calibration: The segment is 'aspiring communities', which are not typically high-income or highly financially literate, so no positive adjustment is warranted. 4) Qualitative: Media usage is broad but not strongly indicative of financial acumen. 5) Evidence hierarchy: No direct quantitative match, so baseline is only slightly adjusted downward (slightly lower agreement, slightly higher neutrality/disagreement) to reflect moderate engagement and possible overstatement bias. 6) Increased variance: Pushed 'neither' higher to reflect likely uncertainty/self-doubt in this segment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=9.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: 1. Concept type: This is an 'attitude' item, so the baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%.
2. Quantitative evidence: Only 29% manage savings accounts online at home/work, suggesting moderate digital financial engagement. No direct evidence of strong money management confidence. Outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services are high (41.5%), which may indicate less tight budgeting. Only 5% are very worried about car theft, suggesting moderate risk aversion but not necessarily strong financial management.
3. Qualitative: Media consumption is broad but not directly relevant to money management confidence.
4. Demographic calibration: None strongly indicated; 'Aspiring Communities' are not especially high or low income, so no major adjustment.
5. Adjustment: Given the lack of strong positive quantitative evidence, and the tendency for self-assessment to be slightly inflated, I slightly reduce agreement from the baseline and increase 'neither' and 'disagree' responses.
6. Variance: Increased 'neither' and 'disagree' to avoid regression to mean, as evidence does not support high agreement.
Confidence is moderate-high due to decent quantitative proxies but no direct measure of self-assessed money management.
Run 4: Strongly agree=9.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an attitude item. The conservative attitude baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows only 29% manage savings online (suggesting moderate financial engagement), and only 5% are very worried about car theft (suggesting low financial anxiety). There is no direct evidence of high financial confidence, and the segment's outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services are high (41.5%), which may indicate less disciplined spending. No qualitative evidence suggests strong financial self-efficacy. Therefore, I slightly lower agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement versus the baseline. Confidence is moderate-high due to relevant quantitative proxies but no direct measure.
Run 5: Strongly agree=9.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: 1. Concept type is 'attitude', so the revised attitude baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. 2. Quantitative evidence: Only 29% manage savings online (suggests moderate digital/financial confidence), and only 5% are very worried about car theft (suggests low anxiety, but not directly relevant). High private car ownership (87%) and high miscellaneous spending (41.5%) suggest moderate affluence but not necessarily strong money management skills. 3. No direct quantitative evidence of self-assessed money management skill, so default to baseline. 4. Qualitative evidence (media use) is neutral. 5. No strong demographic calibration needed (no clear high/low income or age signal). 6. To avoid over-prediction, I slightly lower agreement from baseline: SA 9%, A 23%, N 32%, D 22%, SD 14%. 7. Confidence is moderate-high due to reasonable proxies but no direct measure.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies a concept-specific corrective template for the insurance attitude, which is warranted due to known systematic over-prediction. The quantitative evidence from the segment (low agreement with similar 'practical/financial caution' attitudes) directly supports the use of a low-agreement template. The qualitative evidence about planning is acknowledged but correctly weighted as insufficient to override the strong quantitative signal. No demographic calibration is needed, and the repeated application of the template is methodologically sound given the evidence and the explicit system guardrail. Confidence is high that the estimate is well-grounded in the provided evidence.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is subject to a specific corrective template due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp bias in v1). The correct template is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. Quantitative evidence for this segment shows low agreement with similar 'practical/financial caution' attitudes (e.g., only 13% say fuel consumption is most important when buying a car, and only 21% look out for cinema adverts), supporting a low-agreement prediction. There is no direct evidence of high insurance prioritization. The qualitative note about planning and weekly grocery shopping suggests some organization, but not enough to override the strong quantitative signal. No demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and direct template match.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything', which is subject to a specific corrective template due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp bias in v1). The segment is 'Aspiring Communities', with direct quantitative evidence showing only 13% agree that 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (a similarly practical, risk-averse attitude). This low agreement supports a low prediction for insurance importance as well. The qualitative note about planning and weekly grocery shopping suggests some forward-thinking, but not enough to override the strong quantitative evidence. Therefore, the high friction behavior template with the concept-specific correction is applied: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. Confidence is high due to the strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence and the explicit corrective template.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is subject to a specific correction due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp bias in v1). The segment's quantitative topline for a similar 'fuel consumption is most important' attitude is very low (13%), and other attitude items are also low (13-21%), indicating a generally low tendency to strongly agree with attitudinal statements in this group. The concept type is 'attitude', but the insurance item is known to behave more like a high-friction behavior (people rarely prioritize comprehensive insurance in practice), so the high-friction correction template is used: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. No demographic calibration is warranted (no evidence of high-income or elderly skew), and the qualitative note about planning ahead does not override the strong quantitative evidence of low agreement. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and a strong concept-specific correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is subject to a specific corrective template due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp bias in v1). The correct template for this is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The available quantitative evidence for this segment (Aspiring Communities) shows low agreement with other 'responsibility' or 'practicality' attitudes (e.g., only 13% say fuel consumption is most important when buying a car), which supports a low agreement prediction. There is no direct evidence of high insurance prioritization, and the qualitative note about planning/shopping weekly does not indicate a strong insurance focus. No demographic calibration is warranted. Therefore, I use the concept-specific correction template directly, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment and the explicit system guardrail for this item.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is subject to a specific correction due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp bias). The correct template is the HIGH FRICTION BEHAVIOR correction: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. Quantitative evidence for this segment shows very low agreement with other 'responsibility' or 'future planning' attitudes (e.g., only 13% agree fuel consumption is most important when buying a car, 21% look out for cinema adverts, 13% for soft drinks), indicating a low tendency to prioritize 'responsible' or 'protective' behaviors. The qualitative note about planning groceries weekly suggests some forward planning, but this is weak and does not outweigh the strong quantitative evidence. No demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and the concept-specific correction.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.87
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The topline quantitative data shows very low rates of veganism and vegetarianism (1% and 4%, respectively), with a large majority (76%) eating meat, and a moderate minority (18%) pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This supports the rationale that strong agreement with healthy eating as a core value is likely modest. The qualitative notes suggest some health-conscious lifestyle elements (outdoor pursuits, cycling), but these are not strong enough to override the quantitative dietary evidence. The adjustment from the conservative attitude baseline is reasonable, with agreement categories reduced and neutrality/disagreement increased. The rationale is consistently applied across runs, and confidence is appropriately high due to the strength of the quantitative evidence. No major revisions are needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.20%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 32.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the conservative baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, direct quantitative evidence shows extremely low vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) rates, and a very high proportion (76%) eat meat, with 18% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may express interest in healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly health-oriented (at least not in the sense of plant-based or restrictive diets). Qualitative notes (outdoor pursuits, cycling, pets) suggest some health-consciousness, but not enough to override the quantitative data. Therefore, I have shifted the distribution downward from the baseline, reducing agreement and increasing disagreement, while slightly increasing 'neither' to reflect ambivalence. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, direct quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 18% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 76% eating meat. This suggests that while some may express positive attitudes toward healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with health-focused or restrictive diets. The qualitative notes (outdoor pursuits, cycling, pets, eating out) suggest some lifestyle interest in health, but not enough to override the quantitative evidence. Therefore, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement compared to the baseline. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude type). Direct quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 18% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 76% eating meat. This indicates low prevalence of strong healthy eating behaviors (as typically defined by plant-based or flexitarian diets). Qualitative notes mention 'eating out' and outdoor activities, but do not strongly indicate a health-focused eating attitude. Using the conservative attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%), I adjust downward due to the very low vegan/vegetarian rates and high meat consumption, suggesting less agreement with healthy eating as a core value. I increase 'neither' and 'disagree' categories accordingly. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=9.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude type). Quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, 18% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, and 76% eat meat. This indicates a low prevalence of restrictive healthy eating behaviors, suggesting that strong agreement with healthy eating as a value is likely modest. Qualitative notes (outdoor pursuits, cycling, pets) suggest some health-consciousness, but not enough to override the quantitative data. Using the conservative attitude template (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%) as a baseline, I adjust downward for agreement due to the low rates of vegan/vegetarianism, and upward for 'neither' and 'disagree' to reflect the dominance of meat-eating. Final distribution: SA 9%, A 22%, N 32%, D 22%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the conservative baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, direct quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 18% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 76% eating meat. This suggests that while some may value healthy eating, the actual prevalence of restrictive or health-driven diets is low. Qualitative notes (outdoor pursuits, cycling, pets) hint at some health-consciousness, but not enough to override the quantitative data. Therefore, I shift the distribution downward from the baseline, reducing agreement and increasing neutrality/disagreement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.76
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence ('Plans to use other investments for retirement' at 15%) as a proxy for proactive personal responsibility for retirement, which is appropriate given the lack of a direct measure. The use of the attitude baseline and the modest upward adjustment for above-average income is reasonable and conservative, reflecting the weak direct evidence for strong personal responsibility attitudes. The qualitative context is used appropriately to justify only a slight increase in agreement. The distribution is kept close to the baseline, with only minor adjustments, which is methodologically sound given the evidence. Confidence is moderate to high due to the strong alignment between the evidence and the prediction. No major revisions are needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 27.80%
  Slightly disagree: 18.80%
  Strongly disagree: 13.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: This is an attitude item. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (15%), which is low, suggesting little proactive personal planning for retirement in this segment. The segment is home-owning, above-average income, but the low investment planning figure suggests a lack of strong personal responsibility orientation. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the above-average income, a small +5pp adjustment to agreement is justified, but the low investment planning figure (15%) and moderate agreement with 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' (34%) suggest only a modest sense of personal responsibility. Therefore, I slightly lift agreement but keep it close to baseline. Confidence is moderate due to strong quantitative evidence and some qualitative support.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The item is an attitude statement about personal responsibility for retirement security. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (15%), which is low, suggesting limited proactive planning. 'I only save for a specific purpose' (28%) also indicates a minority with strong saving discipline. The segment is home-owning, above-average income families/couples, which would slightly increase agreement, but not dramatically. The baseline for attitude items is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low evidence for proactive retirement planning, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No direct evidence suggests strong collectivist attitudes, so I do not push disagreement higher. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative proxies.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is an attitude item. There is no direct quantitative match, but the closest proxy is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (15%), which suggests low proactive planning for retirement. Other relevant items ('I only save for a specific purpose' at 28%, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 34%) indicate moderate to low financial engagement. The segment is home-owning families/couples with above-average incomes, which would slightly increase agreement, but the evidence hierarchy prioritizes the low quantitative agreement on related retirement planning. Therefore, I start from the attitude template (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%), and nudge agreement up slightly (+2pp) for above-average income, but not much further due to the weak direct evidence. Disagreement is also nudged up slightly due to the low proactive planning. This results in a conservative, slightly right-skewed distribution with increased variance, in line with V2 guidance.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.74 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about personal responsibility for retirement security. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (15%), which is low, suggesting limited proactive planning. 'I only save for a specific purpose' (28%) also indicates a relatively low level of active, goal-driven saving. The segment is home-owning, above-average income families/couples, which would slightly lift agreement, but not dramatically. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low evidence for proactive retirement planning, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No strong evidence for polarization, so variance is moderate. Confidence is moderate-high due to relevant quantitative proxies.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: This is an attitude item. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (15%), which is low, suggesting limited proactive retirement planning. 'I only save for a specific purpose' (28%) also indicates a lack of broad, general saving behavior. The segment is home-owning families/couples with above-average incomes, which would slightly increase personal responsibility attitudes, but the effect is muted by the low direct evidence. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. I slightly lift agreement (+3pp) for above-average income, but not more, as direct evidence is weak. The result is a conservative, low-agreement prediction, with increased variance as per v2 instructions. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale consistently applies the high-friction behavior template, incorporates the concept-specific correction for prior over-prediction, and carefully considers the available quantitative and qualitative evidence. The demographic characteristics (home-owning, above-average income, higher housing turnover) are acknowledged, but not over-weighted, as there is no direct evidence of higher switching rates or strong cost sensitivity. The quantitative data on outgoings and the qualitative profile are used appropriately to support a conservative approach, and the lack of direct evidence for switching behavior is correctly noted. The confidence is high due to strong alignment with the template and the evidence base. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as a high friction behavior, as it requires effort and is known for high inertia. The baseline for high friction behavior is SA 5%, A 18%, N 27%, D 28%, SD 22%. However, the concept-specific correction for this item is to REDUCE by 15pp from prior over-prediction, so the template is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows this segment has above average incomes and is home-owning, which could slightly increase willingness to engage in switching (as they may be more financially literate and motivated by savings), but the effect is modest (+0-2pp at most). No direct quantitative evidence on switching behavior is provided, so the concept-specific template is used with minimal demographic adjustment. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and some demographic alignment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is a high friction behavior (requires effort, paperwork, and overcoming inertia). The baseline for high friction behavior is: SA 5%, A 18%, N 27%, D 28%, SD 22%. However, this segment consists of home-owning families and couples with above average incomes, which could slightly increase the likelihood of engagement with utility switching due to higher financial literacy and incentive to save on larger bills. Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and housing, suggesting awareness of these costs, but not necessarily a higher propensity to switch. The sporting event attendance (0.20) and places of worship (0.09) are not directly relevant. Demographic calibration for above average income is +5pp, but per V2 instructions, this should be applied conservatively. Therefore, I slightly lift agreement (SA/A) by 2pp each and reduce disagreement by 3pp total, resulting in: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. This maintains the high friction baseline but acknowledges the segment's slightly higher engagement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative and qualitative alignment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is a high-friction behavior. The baseline for this type is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows this segment (Aspiring Communities) has above-average incomes and are home-owning families/couples, but there is no direct evidence of high switching rates or strong cost sensitivity. The outgoings on utilities are high (£3752/year), but this is not unusual for homeowners and does not indicate a strong motivation to switch. Sporting event attendance (0.20) and places of worship (0.09) are not directly relevant. The qualitative note suggests stability and above-average income, which may slightly reduce inertia, but not enough to warrant a positive calibration. Therefore, the concept-specific correction for this item (reduce by 15pp from previous over-prediction) is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is a high friction behavior. The baseline for this type is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence does not indicate unusually high price sensitivity or switching activity: council tax/utilities outgoings are high (suggesting ability to pay), but sporting event attendance (20%) and places of worship (9%) do not indicate strong cost-cutting or inertia-breaking behaviors. Qualitative notes describe above-average income, home-owning families/couples, and high housing turnover, which could slightly increase openness to switching, but not enough to override the high friction baseline. No direct evidence of high switching rates or strong agreement. Therefore, the concept-specific correction for this item (reduce by 15pp from previous over-prediction) is applied without further upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with both evidence and the revised template.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort', which is classified as a high friction behavior. The baseline for this type is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence does not directly address switching behavior, but the segment is described as home-owning families/couples with above average incomes and higher housing turnover, which could slightly increase openness to switching. However, the systematic over-prediction bias for this concept (+15pp) means we should use the corrected template, not increase agreement. No direct evidence suggests higher or lower switching rates, so the concept-specific correction is applied without further demographic lift. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong concept-specific correction and relevant segment context.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.86
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references strong quantitative proxies (online purchase rates for various categories) and a relevant qualitative note ('Internet usage: Moderate'). The evidence selection is balanced and directly relevant to the concept of cash preference. The application of the concept-specific correction is appropriate, and no demographic lift is warranted given the segment profile. The confidence is high due to the alignment between evidence and prediction, and the repeated consistency across runs further supports the robustness of the estimate. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 23.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.86 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 20%, pet care 22%), moderate for home appliances (51%), and higher for holiday/travel (59%). This suggests a moderate-to-high preference for cash or in-person transactions, especially for everyday items. The qualitative note ('Internet usage: Moderate') supports that this segment is not highly digital, but not strongly offline either. According to the V2 guidelines, the concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to reduce agreement by 12pp from the attitude baseline, reflecting higher digital adoption than attitudes suggest. Therefore, the distribution is: SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and a relevant qualitative note.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases' (attitude). Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 20%, pet care 22%), moderate for home appliances (51%), and higher for holiday/travel (59%). This suggests a segment that is less digitally engaged for routine purchases, but not entirely offline. The qualitative note ('Internet usage: Moderate') supports this. The concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is: SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. No strong demographic lift or suppression is warranted. The evidence is mostly quantitative and directly relevant, so confidence is high.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'), so the attitude baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, the quantitative evidence shows that online purchasing rates are low for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 20%, pet care 22%), moderate for home appliances (51%), and higher for holiday/travel (59%). This suggests that for routine purchases, this segment is less likely to use online channels, implying a higher preference for cash than the general population. However, the qualitative note says 'Internet usage: Moderate', not low, so digital adoption is not minimal. According to the concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash', the template is SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. No further demographic calibration is needed as the evidence is segment-specific and matches the concept. The prediction closely follows the corrected template, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). Direct quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for this segment: only 20% for alcoholic drinks, 22% for pet care, 51% for home appliances, and 59% for holiday/travel. The most relevant proxies are the low rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks, pet care), suggesting a preference for offline/cash transactions. Qualitative evidence ('Internet usage: Moderate') supports only moderate digital adoption. According to the V2 guidelines, the concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to reduce agreement by 12pp from the attitude baseline, resulting in a more even spread and lower overall agreement. No demographic lift is applied, as this is not a low-income or elderly segment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and clear qualitative support.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 20%, pet care 22%), moderate for home appliances (51%), and higher for holiday/travel (59%). This suggests a segment with moderate digital adoption and a likely above-average preference for cash compared to the general population. The qualitative note ('Internet usage: Moderate') supports this. Applying the concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' (SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%), which is already calibrated for over-prediction, fits the evidence well. No further demographic lift is warranted. Confidence is high due to strong direct quantitative proxies and a matching qualitative profile.
