### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.70
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run correctly identifies that the available quantitative evidence (country of birth, current account management by phone) is not directly relevant to the attitude concept being estimated. The values are low and do not indicate a need for demographic calibration. There is no strong qualitative evidence to suggest a different distribution. Therefore, applying the V4 baseline for attitudes is methodologically sound. The confidence is moderate to high due to the strong fit of the template and absence of contradictory evidence. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction required, as the context does not indicate a systematic over- or under-prediction for this generic 'Concept'. The quantitative evidence provided relates to behaviors (e.g., managing accounts by phone, country of birth) but does not directly inform the attitude distribution, and the values are low (all <0.16), suggesting no need for demographic calibration. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the general attitude baseline is used. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence for the specific concept.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided is not directly related to the target concept (it covers country of birth and current account management by phone), so it does not justify deviation from the baseline. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the general V4 attitude template is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided is not directly related to the target concept (it covers country of birth and current account management by phone), and the qualitative notes are not informative for this concept. Therefore, no concept-specific or demographic calibration is warranted. The default V4 attitude template is used, with moderate confidence due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The provided quantitative evidence is not directly related to the target concept (it covers country of birth and current account management by phone), and there is no strong qualitative evidence or anchor distribution for this specific attitude. Therefore, the general V4 attitude template is used without further adjustment. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit but limited direct evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline template is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. No concept-specific correction is indicated, as the target concept is generic ('Concept') and not one of the systematically miscalibrated items. The quantitative evidence provided (current account management/arrangement by phone, country of birth) is not directly relevant to the attitude concept, and the values are low (all <0.16), so they do not warrant deviation from the baseline. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the default V4 attitude distribution is used. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.86
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run consistently references the relevant quantitative evidence: very low self-identification as environmentalist (8%) and moderate skepticism toward energy companies (29%), both below national averages. This supports the use of the V4 corrected baseline, which accounts for systematic over-prediction of environmental attitudes. No evidence is presented that would warrant an upward adjustment. The distribution maintains appropriate variance and aligns with both the concept type and the segment's quantitative profile. The justification is clear, methodologically sound, and confidence is high.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 23.00%
  Strongly disagree: 17.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude: 'I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events.' The V4 baseline for this concept is 30% agreement (8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree), reflecting a major correction for systematic over-prediction (+15pp in V3). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows very low self-identification as environmentalist (8%) and moderate skepticism toward energy companies' environmental concern (29%). These values are both below national averages, suggesting this segment is less engaged with environmental issues than average. There is no evidence of higher-than-baseline environmental concern, so no upward demographic calibration is warranted. The V4 corrected baseline is therefore appropriate, and the evidence supports keeping agreement at or slightly below this level. The distribution maintains variance and aligns with both the concept type and the segment's quantitative profile.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.89 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 cross-class analysis shows this item is systematically over-predicted, so the corrected baseline is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). The direct quantitative evidence for 'I consider myself an environmentalist' is very low (8%), and 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' is moderate (29%), both suggesting low environmental engagement in this segment. No evidence suggests higher agreement than the V4 baseline, so the general correction is applied without upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between the segment's low environmental self-identification and the V4 cross-class correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events'), so the V4 baseline for this item is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). This is a major correction from V3 due to systematic over-prediction (+15pp) found across all classes. The quantitative evidence shows only 8% of this segment consider themselves environmentalists, and only 29% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating relatively low environmental concern. There is no evidence of higher-than-average environmental engagement in this segment. Therefore, the general V4 correction is appropriate, and no upward demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between the V4 cross-class correction and the segment's low environmental self-identification.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability, which V4 identifies as systematically over-predicted in all classes. The V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows only 8% consider themselves environmentalists (very low), and 29% are skeptical of energy companies' environmental concern. This supports the V4 correction: agreement is likely low, with a large neutral/disagree block. No evidence suggests this segment is more pro-environment than average. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 cross-class analysis shows this item is systematically over-predicted, so the baseline is set at 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows only 8% consider themselves environmentalists (very low), and 29% are skeptical of energy companies' environmental concern. This suggests a low level of environmental engagement, supporting the use of the V4 corrected baseline without upward demographic adjustment. No evidence suggests this segment is more pro-environmental than average. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the well-calibrated V4 baseline for the attitude 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home,' which is supported by the evidence hierarchy. The quantitative toplines do not provide direct evidence for or against deviation from the baseline, and the qualitative context is not available. The segment's digital and financial attitudes are not directly relevant to energy-saving attitudes, and the only related attitude ('I make an effort to support local businesses') is in a different domain and at a low level, but this does not warrant deviation from the general population baseline. The repeated application of the V4 baseline is methodologically sound given the absence of contradictory or strongly segment-specific evidence. Confidence is high due to the direct mapping to a well-calibrated template and lack of conflicting evidence.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.00%
  Slightly agree: 40.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 15.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an 'attitude' item, but specifically one that is well-calibrated in V4 ("Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home"). The V4 baseline for this item is: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement), and this should be used unless strong segment evidence suggests otherwise. The quantitative evidence from the segment does not directly address energy-saving attitudes, but the segment's digital and financial attitudes (moderate digital confidence, moderate openness to chatbots) do not indicate a strong deviation from the general population. The qualitative context is not available, so no further adjustment is warranted. Therefore, the well-calibrated V4 baseline is applied. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative calibration for this concept.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude (not high friction behavior), and the V4 baseline for 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is well-calibrated at 70% agreement (30% SA, 40% A). There is no evidence in the provided quantitative toplines or qualitative notes to suggest this segment is significantly above or below the general population for this attitude. The segment's digital attitudes and financial attitudes are not directly relevant to energy-saving at home. The only related attitude ('I make an effort to support local businesses', 14% agreement) is much lower, but this is a different domain and not directly comparable. Therefore, the general V4 baseline is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong evidence hierarchy and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 3: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude (not high friction behavior), and the V4 baseline for this specific item ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home') is well-calibrated and should be kept unchanged: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. The segment ('Metropolitan Surroundings') shows moderate digital engagement and a low rate of strong local business support (0.14), but these do not directly contradict the general UK pattern for this item. No quantitative evidence suggests a need to adjust the baseline. Therefore, the standard V4 distribution is applied. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with well-calibrated cross-class evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but specifically about energy-saving behavior at home, which is well-calibrated in V4 (no systematic over/under-prediction). The V4 baseline for this item is: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). Quantitative evidence from the segment shows moderate digital engagement and a low tendency to support local businesses, but nothing to suggest a deviation from the general population on energy-saving attitudes. No demographic calibration is needed. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong evidence hierarchy and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is classified as a 'Behavior (Low Friction)' item, but in the V4 template it is specifically listed as a well-calibrated concept, so the V3 values are retained: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows moderate engagement with digital tools (chatbots: 35% agree) and low confusion with computers (16% agree), suggesting a population that is moderately open to behavioral change and digital engagement. There is no direct evidence of strong pro-environmental attitudes, but the absence of strong negative attitudes and the urban context (Metropolitan Surroundings) supports the baseline. No demographic calibration is needed as the segment does not indicate strong deviation from the general population. Confidence is high due to direct mapping to a well-calibrated V4 template and lack of conflicting evidence.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car,' which is warranted due to systematic over-prediction in previous versions. The most relevant quantitative evidence ('Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions', value=0.43) is appropriately considered as related but not identical, and the rationale correctly notes that environmental friendliness is broader than fuel consumption and that 'most important' is a higher bar than 'important.' Other available evidence is less relevant, and no demographic or qualitative adjustments are warranted for this segment. The repeated application of the V4 correction is justified by the evidence hierarchy and cross-class consistency. Confidence is high due to strong methodological alignment and appropriate evidence weighting.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 25.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the V4 prompt specifies a concept-specific correction for this item due to systematic over-prediction in V3. The corrected baseline for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). 

The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action topline: 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.43). This is related but not identical; environmental friendliness is broader than just fuel consumption, and the value (0.43) is higher than the V4 baseline for 'fuel consumption' (0.15 agreement). However, the V4 correction is based on cross-class over-prediction, so the lower baseline is appropriate. The other evidence (attitudes about energy companies, insurance, pet care) is less directly relevant. 

No strong demographic calibration is warranted for this segment (Metropolitan Surroundings), so the V4 concept-specific baseline is used. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class evidence and a directly relevant quantitative anchor.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the V4 template for this specific item is a concept-specific correction: it is systematically over-predicted, so the correct baseline is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the segment's 0.43 value for 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (relevance 0.98), which is moderately high but not dominant. This supports a moderate but not high agreement, and the V4 correction already accounts for the tendency to over-predict agreement on this item. No demographic calibration is needed (segment is not flagged as high/low income or age-skewed). The other evidence (attitudes to energy companies, insurance, pet care) is less relevant. Therefore, the V4 corrected template is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchor and high cross-class consistency for this correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the V4 template applies a concept-specific correction due to systematic over-prediction in V3. The corrected baseline for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the segment's 43% agreement with 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.43), which is related but not identical—environmental friendliness is broader than just fuel consumption, and 'most important' is a higher bar than 'important.' The next most relevant evidence is much lower (e.g., only 13% for 'well insured for everything'), so the baseline is appropriate. No strong demographic calibration is needed for this segment. The evidence hierarchy supports the use of the concept-specific correction as primary, with the quantitative evidence providing moderate support but not enough to override the V4 correction. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class consistency in the error correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about car-buying priorities, specifically fuel consumption as the most important feature. V4 guidance for this concept is to use the 'Fuel consumption important when buying car' template, which is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting a systematic over-prediction in previous versions. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.43), which is related but not identical—environmental friendliness is broader than just fuel consumption, and the value is moderate (0.43). No evidence suggests this segment is more likely to prioritize fuel consumption than the general population. Other evidence (attitudes toward energy companies, insurance, online research) is less directly relevant. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied without demographic upweighting. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchoring and direct V4 template match.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about fuel consumption being the most important feature when buying a new car. V4 guidance for this concept is to use the corrected baseline for 'Fuel consumption important when buying car': SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in previous versions. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action metric 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 43%, but this is broader than just fuel consumption and likely overstates agreement with the more restrictive 'most important feature' framing. The segment's attitudes toward environmental issues are moderate (29% agree energy companies don't care about the environment), and the insurance and online research metrics are not directly relevant. No qualitative evidence is available. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, with no upward adjustment, as the evidence does not suggest higher agreement than the general population. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with V4 cross-class corrections and the available quantitative anchor.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale across all runs consistently notes that there is no direct quantitative evidence about debt aversion in the toplines, but the segment's moderate risk tolerance (33% agree to 'I do not mind taking risks with my money') is not high enough to warrant a deviation from the well-calibrated V4 baseline. The other toplines (community engagement, climate concern, likelihood to move) are not directly relevant to debt attitudes. The repeated use of the well-calibrated V4 baseline is appropriate, and the confidence is high due to the strong evidence hierarchy and lack of contradictory evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' type, so the V4 baseline is SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about debt aversion in the provided toplines, but the segment shows moderate risk tolerance (33% agree to 'I do not mind taking risks with my money'), which could slightly reduce debt aversion, but not enough to override the well-calibrated V4 baseline. The other toplines (community, climate, moving) are not directly relevant. No demographic calibration is needed as there is no strong evidence of deviation from the general population. Therefore, the well-calibrated V4 baseline for this concept is used. Confidence is high due to the strong evidence hierarchy and the concept being well-calibrated in V3/V4.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement, so the V4 attitude baseline applies: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, the provided quantitative evidence shows relatively low agreement with other pro-social and risk-averse attitudes in this segment (e.g., only 12% help out in the community, 28% see climate change as the biggest threat, 33% are risk-tolerant with money). These suggest a moderate-to-low tendency toward strong agreement with cautious or conservative financial attitudes. However, 'not liking debt' is a widely held attitude in the UK, and the V3/V4 calibration for this concept is well-tuned (43% agreement). There is no evidence to suggest this segment is dramatically different from the general population on this attitude, so the V4 baseline is appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to the well-calibrated baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), so the V4 baseline for attitudes is used: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, this concept is one of the four that is well-calibrated in V3/V4 (error < 1pp), so the template is not adjusted further. There is no direct quantitative evidence on debt aversion in the provided toplines, but the segment's moderate agreement with risk-taking (33% agree) and low community engagement (12%) suggest a typical, not extreme, risk profile. No demographic calibration is applied, as there is no evidence of strong deviation from the general population. Therefore, the well-calibrated V4 template is used. Confidence is high due to the strong evidence base and cross-class calibration.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude item. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the standard attitude baseline (SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence from this segment shows moderate agreement with risk-taking (33% agree to risk with money), but low levels of community engagement (12%) and moderate concern about climate change (28%). There is no direct evidence suggesting this group is unusually tolerant or intolerant of debt, so the general population baseline is appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the well-calibrated baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is classified as an attitude. According to the V4 baseline, this item is well-calibrated and should not be adjusted from the V3 template: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence from this segment shows moderate concern for risk (risk-taking with money = 0.33), which is slightly above average, but not enough to warrant a downward adjustment. There is no direct evidence suggesting this segment is more tolerant of debt than the general population. The other toplines (helping out in the community, climate change concern, likelihood to move) do not directly relate to debt attitudes. Therefore, the general population baseline is most appropriate. Confidence is high due to the strong evidence base and the well-calibrated nature of this concept.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.78
Critic confidence: 0.92
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 baseline for identity statements, specifically for 'I am very good at managing money,' and correctly applies the -6pp correction for systematic over-prediction in V3. The quantitative evidence (e.g., 23.6% manage savings online, 69% privately owned cars) is interpreted appropriately as indicating moderate financial engagement, with no strong evidence for deviation from the general population. The qualitative profile is also considered and found not to warrant further adjustment. The one run that slightly lowers agreement (Run 5) does so with a transparent rationale based on the segment's slightly below-average online financial engagement. The evidence selection is balanced and contextually appropriate. No further demographic calibration is warranted given the available data. Overall, the estimate is well-grounded in the provided evidence and methodological guidance.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 24.60%
  Slightly agree: 33.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.20%
  Slightly disagree: 12.40%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity concepts is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, V4 also specifies a moderate correction for this specific concept: reduce agreement by 6pp due to systematic over-prediction in V3. This yields SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). 

The segment 'Metropolitan Surroundings' shows moderate online financial management (24% manage savings online), suggesting neither high nor low financial self-efficacy. No strong evidence for further demographic calibration is present. The qualitative profile does not indicate a strong deviation from the general population for this identity statement. 

Therefore, the corrected V4 template for this concept is applied directly, with moderate confidence due to the lack of highly specific segment evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for this concept is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), after correcting for a moderate over-prediction bias found in V3. The provided quantitative evidence (e.g., 23.6% manage savings online, high private car ownership, moderate concern about car theft) does not indicate either unusually high or low financial self-efficacy for this segment. The qualitative profile for 'Metropolitan Surroundings' does not suggest a strong deviation from the general population in terms of money management self-perception. Therefore, the V4 corrected identity baseline is applied without further demographic calibration. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong cross-class calibration and lack of segment-specific evidence to shift the estimate.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity concepts is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, for this specific concept, V4 applies a moderate correction (-6pp) due to systematic over-prediction in V3, resulting in SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). 

The provided quantitative evidence (e.g., 23.6% manage savings online, 69% privately owned cars) suggests moderate financial engagement and some asset ownership, but not exceptionally high. There is no evidence of either strong financial distress or exceptional financial acumen. The qualitative profile for 'Metropolitan Surroundings' does not indicate a strong deviation from the general population in terms of financial self-perception. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline for this identity concept is appropriate, with no further demographic calibration needed. Confidence is moderately high due to alignment between the evidence and the V4 correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity concepts is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, V4's cross-class analysis found that this concept was over-predicted by +6pp in V3, so the corrected V4 template is SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). 

The quantitative evidence from this segment (Metropolitan Surroundings) does not indicate unusually high or low financial self-efficacy: only 24% manage savings online (suggesting moderate digital engagement), and outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services are typical. There is no evidence of extreme affluence or deprivation. Therefore, no demographic calibration is warranted (V4: only ±2pp for high/low income, but not triggered here). 

Thus, the V4 corrected identity template is applied directly, yielding 59% agreement (SA+A), which is well-calibrated for this concept and segment. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class evidence and lack of contradictory segment-specific data.
Run 5: Strongly agree=23.00%, Slightly agree=33.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=21.00%, Slightly disagree=14.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Concept type is 'identity' (self-assessment of money management skill). V4 baseline for 'good at managing money' is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), but for this segment (Metropolitan Surroundings), there is no strong evidence for higher or lower self-confidence in money management. Quantitative evidence shows moderate online savings management (24%), which is slightly below national averages, suggesting slightly less confidence/engagement. No qualitative evidence suggests a strong positive or negative deviation. Therefore, I adjust the baseline down slightly: SA 23%, A 33%, N 21%, D 14%, SD 9% (56% agreement). This maintains V4's correction for over-prediction and reflects the moderate engagement with financial tools. Confidence is moderate-high due to direct quantitative support and well-calibrated baseline.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for agreement with 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is well justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 baseline for a well-calibrated attitude concept, and the direct quantitative evidence (fuel consumption as most important feature at 17%) supports the inference that this segment is not especially risk-averse or focused on practical security. There is no qualitative or quantitative evidence suggesting a deviation from the baseline. The evidence selection is appropriate, and the reasoning is transparent and methodologically sound. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('It is important to be well insured for everything'), and the V4 baseline for this item is to KEEP the V3 values: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The direct quantitative evidence for a similar 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' is 0.17 (17%), which is close to the baseline for agreement, suggesting this segment is not especially high on prioritizing practical or risk-averse features. There is no evidence of higher insurance concern in the qualitative or quantitative context. No demographic calibration is needed, as this is a general metropolitan segment. Therefore, the well-calibrated V4 baseline is applied directly. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and strong cross-class calibration for this concept.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything' (attitude). According to V4, this is a well-calibrated concept, so we use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence for this segment (Metropolitan Surroundings) shows low agreement with similar 'responsibility' or 'practicality' attitudes (e.g., only 17% agree that fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car), suggesting a pragmatic but not highly risk-averse or security-focused profile. There is no evidence to suggest higher agreement than the general baseline. No demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and the concept being well-calibrated in V3/V4.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('It is important to be well insured for everything'), and the V4 baseline for this item is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The direct quantitative evidence for 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.17) suggests a relatively low prioritization of practical/financial caution in this segment, which aligns with the baseline. There is no evidence in the provided context to suggest this segment is more risk-averse or insurance-focused than average. No demographic calibration is warranted. The well-calibrated V4 baseline is therefore applied directly, with high confidence due to strong alignment between the segment's attitudes and the general population baseline for this concept.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is an attitude item. According to the V4 prompt, this concept is among those that are well-calibrated and should retain the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The direct quantitative evidence for a similar 'importance' attitude (fuel consumption as most important feature when buying a car) is low (0.17), supporting a low agreement estimate. There is no evidence in the qualitative notes to suggest this segment is unusually risk-averse or insurance-focused. The segment's other behaviors (mass market clothing, moderate advert attention) do not indicate a strong tendency toward comprehensive insurance. Therefore, the well-calibrated baseline is appropriate, and the evidence hierarchy supports this allocation.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this is a well-calibrated concept, so the baseline template is retained: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The quantitative evidence from the segment (fuel consumption as most important feature when buying a car: 0.17) suggests a relatively low prioritization of practical, risk-averse features, which aligns with the general population's low agreement on comprehensive insurance importance. No segment-specific evidence suggests a higher or lower agreement than baseline. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with both the evidence and the well-calibrated baseline.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes is well justified. The topline quantitative evidence clearly shows a low prevalence of vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) diets, with a majority (65%) eating meat and a significant minority (29%) pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This supports the rationale that while some openness to alternative diets exists, strong health-oriented eating is not dominant. The application of the V4 -22pp correction for systematic over-prediction is methodologically sound and consistently applied across all runs. No qualitative evidence contradicts the quantitative findings, and the lack of demographic calibration is justified by the absence of evidence for deviation from the general population. The confidence is high due to the strong alignment between the evidence and the estimate. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 26.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a -22pp correction for this item due to systematic over-prediction in all classes. The quantitative evidence shows a low prevalence of vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) diets, with a majority (65%) eating meat and a significant minority (29%) pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while there is some openness to alternative diets, the segment is not strongly health-focused in eating habits. The V4 corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is 12% strongly agree, 26% slightly agree, 26% neither, 22% slightly disagree, 14% strongly disagree (38% agreement). No demographic calibration is needed as the evidence does not indicate a strong deviation from the general population. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and the use of a cross-class correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a -22pp correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction in all classes. The quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 29% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 65% eating meat. This suggests that while some may value healthy eating, actual dietary change is limited, supporting a lower agreement rate. The V4 corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is 12% strongly agree, 26% slightly agree, 26% neither, 22% slightly disagree, 14% strongly disagree (38% agreement). This aligns with both the concept-specific correction and the segment's actual eating habits, which show only a minority making strong healthy eating choices. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and the V4 cross-class correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this item due to systematic over-prediction in all classes: agreement must be reduced by 22pp from V3, yielding 38% agreement (SA+A). The quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 29% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 65% eating meat. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with strict healthy eating patterns. The V4 correction is therefore appropriate and supported by the data, as the segment is not especially health-oriented in eating. No demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class evidence and direct quantitative support.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3 across all classes), so the baseline is now 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 29% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 65% eating meat. This suggests that while a minority follow strict healthy eating regimes, a significant portion may have moderate healthy eating attitudes (e.g., flexitarian). However, the low vegan/vegetarian rates reinforce the need for a lower agreement estimate. No qualitative evidence suggests unusually high or low health attitudes. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, with no further demographic calibration needed. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and the cross-class correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is now 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). Quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, 29% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, and 65% eat meat. This suggests that while a minority actively pursue restrictive healthy diets, a larger group may still endorse healthy eating in principle. However, the low vegan/vegetarian rates reinforce the need for a lower agreement estimate. No qualitative evidence suggests unusually high or low health attitudes for this segment. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied without further upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and robust cross-class correction.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' (25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 18% neither, 13% slightly disagree, 9% strongly disagree) is sufficiently justified. The rationale correctly applies the V4 baseline for this attitude item, referencing the evidence hierarchy and noting that the quantitative toplines (e.g., 12% plan to use other investments for retirement) reflect behavior rather than attitude, which is typically higher. The moderate agreement with other financial attitudes (29-48%) supports the use of the general baseline, and the lack of demographic or segment-specific flags further justifies not deviating from the template. The evidence selection is balanced and contextually appropriate. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.00%
  Slightly disagree: 13.00%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is used: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). Quantitative evidence from the segment shows only 12% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting low proactive planning), but this does not directly contradict the attitude of personal responsibility, which is typically higher than actual behavior. Other financial attitudes (saving for a purpose, trust in comparison sites, switching utilities) are in the 29-48% agreement range, but are not directly about retirement responsibility. No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the V4 baseline, and the demographic is not flagged for strong calibration. Therefore, the V4 template is applied as-is. Confidence is high due to direct template match and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is an identity/attitude item. V4 guidance for this concept is to use the moderate correction template: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement), reflecting a slight reduction from V3 due to mild over-prediction. The quantitative evidence from this segment shows low intent to use other investments for retirement (12%), moderate trust in price comparison sites (48%), and moderate agreement that switching utilities is worth the effort (29%). None of these directly contradict the baseline, and there is no strong evidence to further lower or raise the agreement. Demographic calibration is not applied here, as the segment is not flagged as high or low income, young, or elderly. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the well-calibrated nature of this concept in V4.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' item, but V4 guidance treats 'retirement is your responsibility' as a moderate-consistency error, so the baseline is 25/35/18/13/9 (60% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows low intent to use other investments for retirement (12%), moderate trust in price comparison sites (48%), and moderate agreement that switching utilities is worth the effort (29%). These suggest a pragmatic but not highly proactive financial attitude. However, the concept is about responsibility (not action), and V4's cross-class analysis shows this item is generally well-calibrated with only a minor over-prediction bias. No evidence here suggests a need to deviate from the V4-corrected baseline. Therefore, I apply the V4 template for this concept: 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 18% neither, 13% slightly disagree, 9% strongly disagree. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and V4's cross-class calibration.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is an attitude item. V4 baseline for this concept is 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 18% neither, 13% slightly disagree, 9% strongly disagree (60% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3 due to mild over-prediction (+3pp) found in cross-class analysis. 

Quantitative evidence from this segment shows only 12% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting low proactive planning), and moderate agreement with related financial attitudes (e.g., 29% agree switching utilities is worth the effort, 34% only save for a specific purpose, 48% trust price comparison sites). These do not indicate unusually high or low personal responsibility for retirement, so the general V4 baseline is appropriate. No strong demographic calibration is needed for this segment. 

Confidence is high due to strong relevance of the evidence and the well-calibrated V4 baseline for this concept.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' item, but V4 guidance treats 'retirement is your responsibility' as a moderate-consistency error, so the baseline is 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 18% neither, 13% slightly disagree, 9% strongly disagree (60% agreement). The quantitative evidence shows only 12% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting low proactive planning), but this does not directly contradict the attitude that retirement is one's own responsibility—many may agree with the principle but not act on it. The other attitude items (saving for a purpose, trust in comparison sites, switching utilities) are not directly related but suggest moderate financial engagement. No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the V4 baseline for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with cross-class calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run is consistent and methodologically sound: the concept is an attitude, and the V4 baseline is well-calibrated for this item, with historical error below 3pp. The quantitative evidence (moderate outgoings on utilities) does not indicate a need for deviation from the baseline, and there is no qualitative evidence suggesting a segment-specific adjustment. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the absence of contradictory or segment-specific data is appropriately handled by applying the general population baseline. Confidence is high due to the direct match with the well-calibrated template and the lack of evidence warranting adjustment.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude (not a high-friction behavior), so the V4 baseline for 'Switching utilities worth effort' is used: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about attitudes toward switching utilities in the segment, but the outgoings data (notably high council tax/utilities spend) suggests some salience of the topic, though not necessarily higher agreement. The segment's visitation patterns (sporting events, places of worship) do not indicate unusually high or low engagement with switching utilities. No demographic calibration is warranted. The V4 baseline is well-calibrated for this concept, so it is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong evidence hierarchy and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 baseline for this is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. This matches the well-calibrated template for this concept from V3, which had minimal error (|error| < 3pp) and is thus retained in V4. The segment (Metropolitan Surroundings) shows moderate engagement with sporting events (0.21) and places of worship (0.16), but nothing in the quantitative or qualitative evidence suggests a strong deviation from the general population's attitude toward switching utilities. Outgoings data is not directly relevant to attitudes about switching. Therefore, the general template is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to direct match with well-calibrated baseline and lack of segment-specific evidence to adjust.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence shows moderate outgoings on utilities (council tax, water, etc.), but there is no direct evidence of high switching activity or strong attitudes toward switching. The segment's profile does not suggest unusually high or low engagement with utility switching. Therefore, the general template is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct alignment with the well-calibrated baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), and the V4 baseline for this item is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence shows moderate outgoings on utilities (council tax, utilities, water, etc.), but nothing in the data suggests unusually high or low engagement with switching or utility cost sensitivity for this segment. No qualitative evidence indicates a strong deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the well-calibrated V4 baseline is applied without demographic adjustment. Confidence is high due to direct match with the V4 template and absence of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should retain the V3 baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence shows moderate outgoings on utilities (council tax, water, etc.), but there is no direct evidence of high engagement with switching or strong attitudes toward effortful financial behaviors. The segment's profile (Metropolitan Surroundings) does not indicate unusually high or low friction for switching utilities. Therefore, the general population baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to the direct match with the well-calibrated template and lack of segment-specific deviation.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.80
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 baseline for the attitude 'I like to use cash when making purchases,' and this is supported by relevant quantitative evidence: relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks, pet care) suggest that a significant portion of the segment still prefers traditional (potentially cash-based) transactions. The higher online rates for appliances and travel are correctly interpreted as reflecting category-specific digital adoption rather than a general cash aversion. The qualitative and demographic context does not indicate a need for further adjustment. The repeated application of the V4 baseline is methodologically sound given the evidence, and the confidence level is appropriately high due to the strong quantitative anchors. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 24.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). V4 baseline for this is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement). Quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 23%, pet care 25%), but higher for appliances (51%) and travel (62%). This suggests that while online purchasing is growing, a significant portion of this segment still prefers traditional payment methods, supporting the baseline. No strong qualitative evidence to shift the baseline. No demographic calibration needed. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative anchors for related behaviors.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For V4, the baseline for this concept is SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate but not majority preference for cash. The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 23%, pet care 25%), but higher for home appliances (51%) and holiday/travel (62%). This suggests that while online (and thus likely cashless) purchasing is common for big-ticket or planned items, it is less so for everyday purchases, implying some ongoing preference or habit for cash in this segment. However, the overall trend is toward digital payments, so the baseline is not increased. No strong qualitative evidence suggests a higher or lower cash preference for Metropolitan Surroundings. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied without demographic adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For the ACORN 'Metropolitan Surroundings' segment, there is no direct quantitative data on cash preference, but we have strong quantitative evidence on online purchase behavior for various categories: Alcoholic drinks (23%), Pet care (25%), Home appliances (51%), and Holiday/travel (62%). The lower online purchase rates for everyday items (alcohol, pet care) suggest a moderate-to-high baseline preference for in-person transactions, which can correlate with a higher-than-average cash usage attitude compared to highly digital segments. However, the item is an attitude, not a behavior, so agreement will be higher than actual cash usage. Applying the V4 attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%) and adjusting slightly upward for the segment's moderate digital engagement (but not as high as urban core), we use the V4 correction for 'like to use cash' (-3pp from V3), resulting in: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13%. This maintains the required variance and aligns with both the evidence and V4 calibration. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong related quantitative evidence and well-calibrated V4 template.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For V4, the general baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate but not majority preference for cash. Quantitative evidence from the segment shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 23%, pet care 25%), but higher for home appliances (51%) and holiday/travel (62%). This suggests a mixed digital adoption profile: for routine, lower-value purchases, cash preference may be higher, but for larger or less frequent purchases, digital is more common. The qualitative profile for 'Metropolitan Surroundings' does not indicate a strong deviation from the national baseline, and there are no strong demographic signals to adjust the baseline. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors and well-calibrated V4 baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting moderate agreement and a broad spread. Quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 23%, pet care 25%), but higher for appliances (51%) and holidays (62%). This suggests that while digital payments are common for high-value/occasional purchases, cash preference may persist for everyday transactions in this segment. No strong demographic correction is warranted for 'Metropolitan Surroundings' (urban, but not the most affluent or deprived). The qualitative context does not indicate a strong deviation from baseline. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied directly, with moderate confidence due to strong quantitative anchors for related behaviors.
