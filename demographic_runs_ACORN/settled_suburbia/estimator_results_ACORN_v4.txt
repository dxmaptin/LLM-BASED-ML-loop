### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.69
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently explains that the quantitative evidence provided (e.g., country of birth proportions, current account management by phone) is not directly relevant to the target attitude concept, and the qualitative notes do not indicate a need for deviation from the V4 baseline template. The use of the general attitude baseline is appropriate given the lack of strong, directly relevant evidence. Confidence is moderate to high, as there is no conflicting or segment-specific evidence that would warrant adjustment. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline template is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. No concept-specific correction is indicated, as the target concept is generic ('Concept') and not one of the systematically miscalibrated items. The quantitative evidence provided is not directly related to the concept (low relevance, e.g., current account management by phone, country of birth), so it does not justify deviation from the baseline. No strong demographic calibration is warranted, as the evidence does not indicate a segment with a known bias. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence for the specific concept.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline template is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction required, as the context does not indicate a specific attitude (such as healthy eating or environmental sustainability) that would trigger a cross-class adjustment. The quantitative evidence provided (values ranging from 0.0156 to 0.1069) is low and not directly related to the target concept, so it does not warrant deviation from the baseline. No strong demographic calibration is indicated by the evidence. Therefore, the general attitude baseline is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to the lack of conflicting or strong direct evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated for a generic 'Concept', and the provided quantitative evidence (values 0.02–0.11) is not directly relevant to attitudes or agreement levels, nor does it indicate a need for demographic calibration. The qualitative notes are minimal and do not suggest deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the general V4 attitude template is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to lack of conflicting or strong segment-specific evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The target concept is classified as an 'attitude', so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated, and no strong demographic calibration is warranted from the provided evidence (the quantitative values are all low and not directly related to the attitude concept). The evidence hierarchy is dominated by the general template, as the retrieved quantitative data is only tangentially relevant (e.g., current account management by phone, country of birth proportions). No anchor distribution is available. Therefore, the general attitude baseline is used with moderate confidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is used: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided is not directly related to the target concept (it covers country of birth and current account management by phone), so it does not warrant deviation from the baseline. Qualitative context is minimal and does not indicate a need for adjustment. No demographic calibration is applied, as there is no strong evidence for a segment-specific shift. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.86
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence: only 7% of the segment consider themselves environmentalists and 27% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating low environmental engagement. The V4 baseline is appropriately used as a reference, and downward adjustments are made where justified by the segment's specific data. The absence of qualitative evidence is noted, but the high relevance and strength of the quantitative evidence compensates for this. The confidence in the estimate is high, and the justification is methodologically sound.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 7.00%
  Slightly agree: 19.60%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 31.20%
  Slightly disagree: 24.80%
  Strongly disagree: 17.40%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=19.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability, for the 'Settled Suburbia' segment. The V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3. Quantitative evidence shows only 7% consider themselves environmentalists and 27% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating low environmental engagement in this segment. This supports a slight downward adjustment from the V4 baseline, especially for agreement. Therefore, I estimate: Strongly agree 7%, Slightly agree 19%, Neither 32%, Slightly disagree 25%, Strongly disagree 17%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and high relevance of the evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 cross-class analysis shows this item is systematically over-predicted, so the corrected baseline is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment is notably low: only 7% consider themselves environmentalists and 27% think energy companies don't care about the environment, both indicating weak environmental engagement. No qualitative evidence suggests higher concern. Therefore, the general V4 correction is appropriate, and if anything, the segment's agreement may be even lower than the baseline, but the V4 template is already conservative. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class consistency.
Run 3: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=20.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3. The quantitative evidence for this segment shows very low self-identification as environmentalist (7%) and low trust in energy companies' environmental care (27% agree), both below national averages. This suggests even lower agreement than the V4 baseline. No qualitative evidence suggests higher engagement. Therefore, I have reduced both agreement categories by 1-2pp each, and increased 'neither' and 'disagree' accordingly. This yields a predicted agreement of 27% (7%+20%), slightly below the V4 general baseline, which is justified by the segment's low environmental self-identification. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 cross-class analysis shows this item is systematically over-predicted, so the corrected baseline is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). Segment quantitative evidence shows very low self-identification as environmentalist (7%) and low trust in energy companies' environmental care (27%), both indicating weak pro-environmental attitudes in this group. No evidence suggests higher agreement than the V4 baseline, so no upward demographic calibration is warranted. The qualitative context is missing, so no adjustment is made. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and robust cross-class correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability, which V4 identifies as systematically over-predicted in prior versions. The V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). However, the quantitative evidence for this segment (Settled Suburbia) shows extremely low self-identification as environmentalist (7%) and low trust in energy companies' environmental care (27% agreement). This suggests even lower agreement than the V4 baseline. Therefore, I further reduce agreement by ~5pp, resulting in 5% strongly agree, 15% slightly agree, 32% neither, 28% slightly disagree, 20% strongly disagree (20% agreement). This is justified by the segment's low environmental engagement and the strong quantitative evidence. Confidence is high due to the direct, relevant quantitative data.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the well-calibrated V4 baseline for this specific concept, which is supported by the lack of contradictory evidence in the quantitative and qualitative data. The high outgoings on housing/utilities could, if anything, reinforce the plausibility of the baseline agreement rates, but do not provide grounds for deviation. The attitudinal evidence is not directly relevant but does not contradict the baseline. The repeated high-confidence application of the template is methodologically sound given the evidence provided. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.00%
  Slightly agree: 40.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 15.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a low-friction behavior/attitude. According to V4, this is one of the well-calibrated concepts, so the baseline template is SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The provided quantitative evidence does not directly address energy-saving attitudes but does show high spending on housing/utilities (64.4%), which is typical for this segment and does not contradict the baseline. The qualitative and digital attitudes suggest moderate digital engagement but do not indicate a strong deviation from the general population on this item. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong template calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ("Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home"), which is well-calibrated in V4 and should use the unchanged V3 baseline: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. The segment (Settled Suburbia) shows high outgoings on housing/utilities (64.4%), but no evidence of unusually high or low environmental concern or cost sensitivity that would justify deviation from the general template. The closest quantitative attitude (supporting local businesses, 12% agreement) is not directly related and is much lower, but this likely reflects the specific nature of that item rather than a general tendency to disagree with pro-social or cost-saving attitudes. No demographic calibration is needed, as this segment is not flagged for strong deviation. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a low-friction behavior (easy action, not high cost). According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the standard template: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on housing and utilities (64.4%), which may indicate a motivation to reduce costs, supporting the likelihood of agreement. There is no evidence of systematic over- or under-prediction for this concept in V3, so no adjustment is needed. The qualitative context is minimal but does not contradict the baseline. Therefore, the standard V4 distribution is applied with high confidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a high-friction behavior (requires ongoing effort and attention). However, V4 calibration notes this specific item as well-calibrated in V3, so the baseline should be kept: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). Quantitative evidence from the segment shows high outgoings on housing/utilities (64.4%), which may motivate energy-saving behaviors, but no direct evidence suggests a deviation from the general baseline. Qualitative and attitudinal data are weakly relevant and do not contradict the baseline. Therefore, the V4 template is applied without adjustment. Confidence is high due to direct match with a well-calibrated concept and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a low-friction behavior but is treated as a well-calibrated item in V4 (no adjustment from V3). The baseline for this item is SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment (Settled Suburbia) shows high outgoings on housing/utilities (64.4%), but no evidence of unusually high or low environmental or cost-saving attitudes. The provided quantitative and qualitative evidence does not indicate deviation from the general population for this concept. Therefore, the general V4 baseline is applied. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the well-calibrated baseline and lack of contradictory segment evidence.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the evidence hierarchy, prioritizing the most relevant quantitative topline ('environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 0.38) as a proxy for the target concept, while acknowledging its limitations. The V4 baseline correction is appropriately applied due to known systematic over-prediction in V3, and the lack of strong qualitative or demographic evidence for deviation is correctly noted. The repeated runs demonstrate cross-class consistency and high confidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 25.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' The most relevant quantitative topline is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.38), which is closely related but not identical—environmental friendliness overlaps with fuel consumption but is not a perfect proxy. The V4 baseline for this concept (after correcting V3's +5pp over-prediction) is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The segment's topline (0.38) is slightly above the general population baseline, but not enough to warrant a demographic calibration (which would only be +2pp for this segment, and V4 reduces demographic adjustments by 50%). The evidence hierarchy prioritizes the direct quantitative data (0.38), which supports the V4 baseline. No qualitative evidence suggests a major deviation. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action metric: 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 0.38 (38%), which is a closely related but slightly broader environmental concern. The V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3 and cross-class consistency. The segment (Settled Suburbia) does not indicate a strong deviation from the general population for this attitude, and the evidence does not suggest a higher or lower agreement than the V4 baseline. The other evidence (energy companies/environment, insurance, pet care) is less directly relevant. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class consistency.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' item, but the V4 prompt specifies a concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' due to systematic over-prediction in V3. The corrected V4 baseline is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 0.38, which is somewhat higher than the V4 baseline, but this is for environmental friendliness, not specifically fuel consumption, and the V4 correction is based on cross-class over-prediction. No strong qualitative evidence is present to suggest a higher or lower value for this segment. Therefore, I use the V4 corrected baseline for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative and cross-class evidence alignment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the V4 template applies a concept-specific correction due to systematic over-prediction in V3. The correct V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.38), which is higher than the V4 baseline but not by a large margin, and the segment's attitudes toward environmental issues are moderate (energy companies don't care about the environment: 0.27). There is no evidence that this segment is much more environmentally focused than average, so the V4 baseline is appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and clear template guidance.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' item, but the V4 prompt specifies a concept-specific correction for 'Fuel consumption important when buying car' due to systematic over-prediction in V3. The corrected V4 baseline is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the segment's 0.38 agreement with 'environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions important when buying a car'—this is higher than the general population, but still well below 50%, and the target concept is even more restrictive ('most important feature'). No qualitative evidence suggests a higher weighting. Therefore, the V4 concept-specific baseline is appropriate, with no upward demographic calibration (segment is not especially green or affluent). Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and V4 correction.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 well-calibrated baseline for this attitude item, which is appropriate given the lack of direct quantitative evidence on debt aversion in the provided toplines. The segment's low risk-taking and community engagement scores are correctly interpreted as supporting a cautious, risk-averse profile, but not to an extent that would warrant deviation from the baseline. The repeated confirmation across runs, with explicit reference to the calibration status of the item and the absence of contradictory evidence, further strengthens the justification. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' type, so the V4 baseline is SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about debt aversion in the provided toplines, but the segment's low scores on 'helping out in the community' (0.10), 'climate change threat' (0.21), and 'risk with money' (0.19) suggest a moderately cautious, risk-averse profile, which aligns with a moderate to strong dislike of debt. However, these values are not extreme, so the general population baseline is appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed (Settled Suburbia is not a high-variance outlier class). The prediction is well-calibrated per V4, and the confidence is high due to the strong evidence hierarchy and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), so the V4 attitude baseline applies: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, this concept is one of the four well-calibrated items in V4, so the V3 values are retained: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence from the segment shows low risk-taking (19%) and low community engagement (10%), both consistent with risk-averse, stability-oriented attitudes, which supports a moderate-to-high agreement with the anti-debt sentiment. No evidence suggests a need to adjust the baseline. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment evidence and the well-calibrated template.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude statement. According to V4, this item is well-calibrated and should use the standard template: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence from this segment (Settled Suburbia) shows moderate concern for risk (19% agree to risk-taking), low community engagement (10%), and moderate concern about climate change (21%). None of these suggest a strong deviation from the general population on debt aversion. There is no evidence of unusually high or low debt aversion in this segment, so the V4 baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct template match and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), so the V4 attitude baseline applies: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, this concept is one of the four that are well-calibrated in V3 and should be left unchanged (V3 error: -0.2pp). Therefore, the correct distribution is: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence from the segment (Settled Suburbia) shows low risk-taking (0.19) and low community activism (0.10), which aligns with a cautious, risk-averse profile, supporting a slightly higher agreement with debt aversion. No strong demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative alignment and the concept's well-calibrated status.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' type, so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied. There is no direct quantitative evidence about debt aversion in the provided toplines, but the segment's low scores on risk-taking (0.19) and community helping (0.10) suggest a cautious, risk-averse profile, which aligns with a moderate to high dislike of debt. However, without direct evidence, we do not increase the baseline. The V4 template for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is well-calibrated and should be used unchanged: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to the template's proven calibration and the segment's risk-averse signals.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.80
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I am very good at managing money' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 identity baseline, with a well-documented correction for over-prediction (+6pp from V3), resulting in SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9%. The quantitative evidence (moderate online savings management, high private car ownership, moderate miscellaneous spending, low crime worry) supports the view that Settled Suburbia is a stable, moderately affluent segment, but not exceptionally financially sophisticated. There is no evidence of financial distress or exceptional capability that would warrant further adjustment. The absence of strong qualitative evidence is acknowledged, but the quantitative anchors are robust. The repeated rationale across runs demonstrates methodological consistency and careful calibration. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 34.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is classified as an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity concepts is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, the segment 'Settled Suburbia' shows moderate online savings management (29%), high private car ownership (87%), and moderate spending on miscellaneous goods/services. There is no direct evidence of financial distress or exceptional financial acumen. The baseline is slightly adjusted upwards for this segment's likely financial stability, but not by more than 1-2pp, as demographic calibrations are halved in V4. The final estimate closely follows the V4 identity template, with a minor nudge for stability. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors and well-calibrated concept correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an identity statement ('I am very good at managing money'), so the V4 baseline for identity applies: SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, the V4 cross-class correction for this concept is to reduce agreement by 6pp due to moderate over-prediction in V3, resulting in: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9%. Quantitative evidence from this segment (e.g., 29% manage savings online, high private car ownership, moderate miscellaneous spending) suggests a stable, moderately affluent group, but not one with exceptional financial sophistication. No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the corrected V4 baseline. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is moderate-high due to direct quantitative support and well-calibrated V4 baseline.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an identity statement ('I am very good at managing money'), so the V4 identity baseline applies: SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. V4's cross-class analysis found that this concept was over-predicted by +6pp in V3, so the corrected V4 template is SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows moderate online savings management (29%), high private car ownership (87%), and moderate spending on miscellaneous goods/services, which is consistent with a settled, stable, and moderately affluent suburban segment. There is no evidence of financial distress or low capability, so no downward adjustment is needed. No strong demographic calibration is warranted (segment is not especially affluent or deprived). Therefore, the V4 corrected identity baseline is used without further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and well-calibrated V4 baseline.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: This is an IDENTITY-type item ('I am very good at managing money'). V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3 due to systematic over-prediction (+6pp in V3). 

Segment evidence: Settled Suburbia shows moderate online savings management (29%), high private car ownership (87%), and low worry about car theft (5%). These suggest financial stability and responsibility, but not exceptional digital engagement or anxiety about money. No direct evidence suggests a need to adjust the V4 baseline for this segment. 

No demographic calibration is needed (Settled Suburbia is a middle-income, stable group, not at either extreme). No qualitative evidence overrides the baseline. 

Therefore, the V4 corrected identity baseline is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and moderate quantitative support.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity concepts is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, this specific concept has a moderate over-prediction correction (-6pp) based on cross-class analysis, so the adjusted distribution is SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). 

Segment evidence: The quantitative data shows moderate online savings account management (29%), which is not especially high, but the segment is likely to be stable (high private car ownership, low crime worry, high miscellaneous spending). There is no evidence of financial distress or low capability. No demographic calibration is needed (Settled Suburbia is a mid/older, stable, not affluent but not deprived segment). 

Therefore, the V4 corrected identity baseline for this concept is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and no contradictory evidence.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the quantitative evidence (notably, the low agreement with 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' at 12%) to support the use of the V4 baseline template. There is no qualitative or demographic evidence suggesting the need for adjustment. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the application of the well-calibrated baseline is methodologically sound. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything', which is an attitude item. According to the V4 prompt, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The quantitative evidence for 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.12) suggests a relatively low prioritization of practical/financial caution in this segment, which aligns with the baseline. No qualitative evidence is provided that would suggest deviation. Therefore, the baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct alignment with the well-calibrated template and supporting quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to the V4 baseline, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the template: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence for this segment (Settled Suburbia) shows low agreement with similar 'responsibility' or 'importance' attitudes (e.g., only 12% agree that fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car). There is no evidence of unusually high risk aversion or insurance prioritization in the provided data. Therefore, the baseline is applied without upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and the concept being well-calibrated in V4.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this is a well-calibrated concept, so the baseline template is retained: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The quantitative evidence for this segment (Settled Suburbia) shows low prioritization of practical/functional features (e.g., only 12% rate fuel consumption as most important when buying a car), suggesting a pragmatic but not highly risk-averse or protection-oriented mindset. There is no evidence of unusually high insurance concern. No demographic calibration is needed, as this is a middle-of-the-road segment. The evidence hierarchy is dominated by direct quantitative data, which aligns with the baseline. Therefore, the V4 template is applied without adjustment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to the V4 prompt, this item is among the well-calibrated concepts, so the baseline template is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence from the segment ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' = 12%) suggests a generally low prioritization of practical, risk-averse attitudes in this group. There is no evidence of unusually high risk aversion or insurance focus in the provided qualitative or quantitative data. Therefore, the baseline is appropriate and no demographic or concept-specific adjustment is needed. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between the evidence and the well-calibrated baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to the V4 prompt, this item is among the 'well-calibrated' concepts, so the baseline template is retained: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The quantitative evidence from the segment (Settled Suburbia) shows low agreement with similar 'responsibility' or 'practicality' attitudes (e.g., only 12% agree that fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car), which supports the use of the lower baseline. There are no strong demographic or qualitative signals to adjust upward or downward. Therefore, the V4 template for this concept is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong alignment between the template and the segment's quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes in the Settled Suburbia segment is sufficiently justified. The topline quantitative evidence shows very low prevalence of vegan and vegetarian diets (0.6% and 4.4%, respectively), with a large majority eating meat (80%) and a moderate minority pescatarian/flexitarian/other (16%). This supports the rationale that actual healthy eating behaviors are not widespread in this segment. The V4 correction for systematic over-prediction is appropriately applied, and the resulting agreement rate (38%) is well-supported by both the quantitative data and the cross-class correction rationale. No qualitative evidence contradicts this, and no demographic calibration is warranted. The confidence is high due to strong alignment between the evidence and the estimate. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 26.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is now 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows that the vast majority of this segment eats meat (80%), with very low rates of vegan (0.6%) and vegetarian (4.4%) diets, and a moderate minority (16%) pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while there may be some aspiration toward healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. This supports the lower agreement baseline. No demographic calibration is needed, as the evidence is directly segment-specific and matches the general UK pattern for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and the cross-class correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3 across all classes), so the baseline is set at 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows very low vegan/vegetarian rates (0.6% vegan, 4.4% vegetarian), with 80% eating meat and 16% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests actual healthy eating behaviors are not widespread, supporting a lower agreement rate. No qualitative evidence suggests higher health consciousness. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, and no upward demographic calibration is justified. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between the V4 correction and the segment's actual eating patterns.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is now 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 16% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 80% eating meat. This suggests that while a minority actively practice restrictive healthy diets, a larger group may still endorse healthy eating as an attitude. However, the low prevalence of restrictive diets supports the V4 correction to keep agreement low. No demographic calibration is needed (Settled Suburbia is not an outlier for this concept). The distribution is thus: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and V4's cross-class correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude type), and V4 mandates a major correction for this item due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3 across all classes). The corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is now 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%), with the rest distributed per V4 template. The quantitative evidence shows low prevalence of vegan (0.6%) and vegetarian (4.4%) diets, with 80% eating meat and 16% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while actual healthy eating behaviors are rare, attitudes may be higher, but not as high as previously estimated. No strong qualitative evidence is present to override the quantitative baseline. Therefore, the V4 corrected distribution is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong cross-class evidence and direct quantitative support for low prevalence of healthy eating behaviors.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this item due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3 across all classes). The corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is now 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%), with the rest distributed as N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%. The quantitative evidence shows very low vegan/vegetarian rates (1%/4%), high meat consumption (80%), and moderate pescatarian/flexitarian/other (16%), which supports the notion that while healthy eating is valued, actual behavior is less prevalent. However, since the question is about attitude (not behavior), and the V4 correction is based on robust cross-class error analysis, I apply the V4 corrected template directly. No further demographic calibration is needed, as the evidence does not indicate this segment is an outlier. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative and cross-class evidence alignment.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 baseline (60% agreement: 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree) and checks for any segment-specific evidence that would warrant deviation. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., low intent to use other investments for retirement, moderate agreement with saving for a specific purpose) is only weakly related and does not contradict the baseline. There is no strong qualitative or demographic evidence suggesting a need for adjustment. The repeated rationale across runs demonstrates careful consideration and appropriate application of the template. Confidence is high due to the strong alignment with both the V4 template and the available evidence.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.00%
  Slightly disagree: 13.00%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is an attitude item. V4 baseline for this concept is 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 18% neither, 13% slightly disagree, 9% strongly disagree (60% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows low intent to use other investments for retirement (14%), moderate agreement with saving for a specific purpose (28%), and moderate agreement that switching utilities is worth the effort (33%). These do not directly contradict the baseline, but suggest a moderate, not high, sense of personal financial agency. No evidence suggests a need to adjust the V4 baseline for this concept. Demographic calibration is not applied, as this is a well-calibrated concept with low cross-class error. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with V4 template and supporting evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is used: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). The provided quantitative evidence is only weakly related (e.g., 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' at 14%, 'I only save for a specific purpose' at 28%), but these do not directly contradict the baseline. There is no strong evidence to suggest this segment is more or less likely to agree than the general population, and the V4 correction for this concept is already applied (-3pp from V3). Therefore, the general V4 template is appropriate. Confidence is high due to the direct match to a well-calibrated V4 template and lack of strong segment-specific evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is applied: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). Quantitative evidence is limited but does not contradict this: only 14% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting low proactive planning), but this does not directly measure agreement with personal responsibility. No strong qualitative evidence is present. The segment (Settled Suburbia) is not flagged for strong demographic calibration, so the general V4 template is appropriate. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is an attitude statement. V4 baseline for this concept is 60% agreement (25% SA, 35% A), reflecting moderate consensus but not universal agreement. The provided quantitative evidence is only loosely related: 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' is low (14%), suggesting few are proactively planning, but this does not directly contradict the attitude that retirement is one's own responsibility. Other attitudes (e.g., 'I only save for a specific purpose' at 28%) suggest a somewhat pragmatic, purpose-driven approach to finances, but not strong disengagement. No evidence suggests this segment is less likely than average to endorse personal responsibility for retirement. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, with no further demographic calibration (Settled Suburbia is a mid-mainstream segment). Confidence is high due to strong alignment with V4 calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' item, specifically about personal responsibility for retirement security. V4 guidance for this concept is to use the moderate consistency correction: reduce agreement by 3pp from V3, yielding 60% agreement (SA 25%, A 35%). The quantitative evidence from this segment shows low intent to use other investments for retirement (14%), moderate agreement with saving for a specific purpose (28%), and moderate trust in price comparison sites (54%). The most relevant anchor is the V4 template for 'Retirement is your responsibility' (SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9%), which matches the segment's moderate financial engagement and responsibility. No strong demographic calibration is needed, as 'Settled Suburbia' is a middle-income, middle-aged segment, so the base V4 correction applies. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with both the V4 template and the segment's moderate financial attitudes.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the well-calibrated status of the attitude item in V4, and the quantitative evidence (notably high outgoings on council tax, utilities, etc.) is considered but not over-interpreted, as there is no direct evidence of higher switching behavior or stronger attitudes in this segment. The qualitative evidence is acknowledged as limited and not contradictory. The decision to retain the V4 baseline is appropriate and well-supported by the evidence hierarchy. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%

Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is an attitude item. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated (V3 error: -2.1pp), so the baseline template is retained: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows this segment has moderate outgoings on utilities (council tax, water, etc.), but nothing in the qualitative or quantitative data suggests a strong deviation from the general population. Sporting event and place of worship attendance are not directly relevant. Therefore, the general V4 baseline is applied with high confidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is an attitude item. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated in the general population (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related costs, which could slightly increase the salience of utility switching, but not enough to warrant deviation from the well-calibrated baseline. The segment (Settled Suburbia) is not flagged as highly constrained or affluent, so no demographic calibration is applied. There is no qualitative evidence suggesting a strong deviation from the norm. Therefore, the V4 baseline is used. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative relevance and the concept's well-calibrated status in V4.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows that this segment ('Settled Suburbia') has high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and housing-related costs, which could slightly increase motivation to consider switching. However, there is no direct evidence of high switching behavior or strong attitudes toward switching, and the baseline is already designed to reflect moderate agreement. No demographic calibration is applied, as this segment is not flagged for strong deviation. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative alignment and the concept's well-calibrated status in V4.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence from the segment (Settled Suburbia) shows high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related expenses, which might make the topic salient, but there is no direct evidence of higher switching rates or stronger attitudes toward switching. The segment's moderate engagement with sporting events and places of worship does not directly affect this attitude. Therefore, the general baseline is appropriate, with no demographic calibration needed. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the well-calibrated status of this concept in V4.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related bills (value=3743.99), which could slightly increase motivation to switch, but the segment's visitation patterns (low sporting events, low places of worship) do not indicate unusually high engagement or activism. There is no strong qualitative evidence suggesting above-average willingness to switch. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the well-calibrated nature of this concept in V4.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The quantitative toplines show relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks and pet care), which supports the idea that a moderate portion of this segment still prefers cash or in-person transactions for routine purchases. The higher online rates for home appliances and holidays/travel suggest digital adoption for larger or less frequent purchases, but do not contradict the baseline estimate for cash preference. The repeated use of the V4 baseline is appropriate, as there is no strong demographic or qualitative evidence to warrant adjustment. The rationales are consistent and well-grounded in the quantitative data, and the confidence level is appropriately high. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 24.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For 'Settled Suburbia', the quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 16%, pet care 19%), but higher for home appliances (48%) and holiday/travel (63%). This suggests moderate digital adoption, but not as high as more affluent or urban segments. The V4 baseline for this attitude is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), which fits the evidence: some preference for cash remains, but a substantial portion is neutral or leans away from cash. No strong demographic calibration is needed, as this segment is not especially young or elderly, nor especially high or low income. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors and well-calibrated V4 baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For 'Settled Suburbia', the quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks: 16%, pet care: 19%), moderate for home appliances (48%), and high for holidays/travel (63%). This suggests a segment that is less digitally engaged for routine purchases, which correlates with a higher preference for cash than the national average. However, the V4 baseline for this attitude is 13/24/28/22/13 (37% agreement), and the evidence does not justify a major upward adjustment. There is no strong qualitative evidence to override the quantitative pattern. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, with moderate confidence due to strong quantitative alignment and lack of contradictory qualitative data.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For 'Settled Suburbia', the quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks: 16%, pet care: 19%), with higher rates for home appliances (48%) and holiday/travel (63%). This suggests a moderate but not strong preference for digital/online transactions, implying a non-trivial segment still prefers cash, especially for routine or lower-value purchases. The V4 baseline for this attitude is 13% strongly agree, 24% slightly agree, 28% neither, 22% slightly disagree, 13% strongly disagree (37% agreement). No strong demographic calibration is warranted, as the evidence does not indicate a strong digital or cash bias. The qualitative context is missing, so the estimate relies on the quantitative pattern and the V4 template. Confidence is moderate-high due to direct quantitative evidence on payment channel usage.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For V4, the general baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate but not majority preference for cash. Quantitative evidence from the segment shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 16%, pet care 19%), but higher for home appliances (48%) and holiday/travel (63%). This suggests that for routine, lower-value purchases, cash or in-person payment methods are still common in this segment, supporting the baseline. There is no strong evidence to shift the distribution up or down, and no demographic calibration is warranted. The qualitative context is not available, so the estimate relies on the quantitative toplines and the V4 corrected baseline. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For Settled Suburbia, the quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 16%, pet care 19%), but higher for appliances (48%) and especially for holidays/travel (63%). This suggests a segment that is somewhat traditional in day-to-day spending, but adopts online channels for larger or less frequent purchases. The V4 baseline for this attitude is 13% strongly agree, 24% slightly agree, 28% neither, 22% slightly disagree, 13% strongly disagree (37% agreement). The evidence supports using the baseline: the low online rates for routine purchases imply a moderate preference for cash or in-person transactions, but not an overwhelming one. No strong qualitative evidence is provided to shift this. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and the well-calibrated baseline for this concept.
