### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.72
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run correctly identifies that the provided quantitative evidence (account management methods and country of birth) is not directly relevant to the attitudinal concept being estimated. The application of the V4 baseline for attitudes is appropriate in the absence of concept-specific or strongly relevant demographic evidence. The qualitative notes are neutral and do not contradict the use of the baseline. The confidence level is appropriately set at moderate-high due to the strong fit with the template and lack of contradictory evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated, and the provided quantitative evidence is not directly related to the target concept (the values pertain to account management and country of birth, not to a specific attitude statement). No strong demographic calibration is warranted for 'Upmarket Families' based on the evidence provided. Therefore, the general attitude baseline is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to the lack of direct evidence for the specific concept, but the baseline is well-calibrated for attitudes.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated in the prompt, and the provided quantitative evidence is not directly relevant to the attitude concept (it relates to account management and country of birth, not to a specific attitude statement). The demographic segment is 'Upmarket Families', which would normally receive a small positive calibration (+2pp), but V4 guidance is to only apply this if there is strong evidence of relevance, which is not present here. Therefore, the general attitude baseline is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated, and no demographic calibration is triggered by the provided evidence (the quantitative values are low and not directly relevant to attitudinal agreement rates). No strong qualitative or quantitative evidence suggests deviation from the baseline. Confidence is moderate-high due to the clear concept type and lack of conflicting evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated, and the provided quantitative evidence is not directly related to the attitude concept in question, nor does it suggest a need for demographic calibration (the values are low and not strongly indicative of deviation from the baseline). The qualitative notes are neutral and do not provide additional direction. Therefore, the general V4 attitude template is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated, and the provided quantitative evidence is not directly relevant to the attitude concept (it relates to account management and country of birth, not a specific attitude). No demographic calibration is applied, as the evidence does not indicate a need for it. The qualitative notes do not provide additional direction. Therefore, the general V4 attitude baseline is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit but limited direct evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.86
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence: very low self-identification as environmentalist (9%) and low skepticism toward energy companies (24%), both indicating weak environmental concern in the 'Upmarket Families' segment. The use of the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, given the documented systematic over-prediction for this concept. The decision not to apply upward demographic calibration is well-supported by the data. The minor variation in agreement rates (26-30%) across runs is transparently explained as reflecting the segment's below-average environmental orientation. The confidence in the estimate is high due to strong alignment with quantitative evidence and clear methodological reasoning. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 7.60%
  Slightly agree: 20.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.80%
  Slightly disagree: 23.80%
  Strongly disagree: 17.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events'), and V4's cross-class analysis shows systematic over-prediction for this item, requiring a -15pp correction from the general attitude baseline. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (0.09) and 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' (0.24), both indicating low environmental concern in this segment. This supports the need for a conservative estimate. The V4 corrected baseline for this concept is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 23%, SD 17% (30% agreement), which matches the evidence and maintains variance. No demographic upweighting is applied, as upmarket families do not show higher environmental concern in the data. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and V4's systematic correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), due to systematic over-prediction in V3 (+15pp bias). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows very low self-identification as environmentalist (9%) and low distrust of energy companies (24%), both indicating weak environmental concern. No evidence suggests this segment is more pro-environment than the general population. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, with no upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class consistency of the error.
Run 3: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=19.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). For 'Upmarket Families', quantitative evidence shows very low self-identification as environmentalist (9%) and low skepticism toward energy companies (24%), both suggesting below-average environmental concern. No qualitative evidence suggests a higher value. Therefore, I slightly reduce agreement from the V4 baseline to reflect this segment's lower-than-average environmental orientation, resulting in 26% agreement (vs. 30% V4 baseline). This is justified by direct quantitative data (self-ID as environmentalist) and related attitudes. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=19.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4's cross-class analysis shows systematic over-prediction for this concept, so the baseline is set at 30% agreement (SA+A). For 'Upmarket Families', quantitative evidence shows only 9% consider themselves environmentalists and 24% are skeptical of energy companies' environmental care—both notably low for this affluent segment. This suggests even lower pro-environment attitudes than the general baseline. Therefore, I further reduce agreement by 4pp (to 26% SA+A), distributing the difference mainly to 'neither' and 'slightly disagree'. This is supported by the lack of strong qualitative evidence for environmental concern in this segment. The final estimate is: SA 7%, A 19%, N 32%, D 25%, SD 17%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors and the V4 correction for this concept.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 cross-class analysis shows this item is systematically over-predicted, so the corrected baseline is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows very low self-identification as environmentalist (9%) and low agreement that energy companies don't care about the environment (24%), both suggesting even less pro-environmental sentiment than the general population. Upmarket Families are affluent but not especially green-oriented. No evidence suggests a higher agreement than the V4 baseline. Therefore, I use the V4 corrected baseline for this concept type, with no upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class consistency.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 guidance, which states that this attitude item is well-calibrated and should use the standard baseline (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%). The available quantitative evidence from the segment (e.g., support for local businesses, digital attitudes) does not directly contradict or strongly support deviation from the baseline, and the segment's affluence is not shown to systematically affect this specific energy-saving attitude. The absence of contradictory evidence and the explicit reference to calibration guidance provide a strong methodological basis for the estimate. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.00%
  Slightly agree: 40.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 15.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude (moderate spread). V4 guidance says this item is well-calibrated (error <3pp), so we use the standard: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). No strong quantitative evidence in the segment directly contradicts this: the segment is affluent (high outgoings), but nothing suggests unusually high or low environmental concern or energy-saving behavior. The closest relevant attitude ('I make an effort to support local businesses', 16% agreement) is much lower, but this is a different domain and not directly comparable. No demographic calibration is needed (affluent, but not a class with a large correction). Therefore, I use the V4 baseline for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but specifically about energy-saving behavior at home, which is well-calibrated in V4 (no systematic error, so use the V3 baseline: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%). The segment 'Upmarket Families' is affluent and likely to be environmentally aware, but the evidence does not indicate a strong deviation from the general population. Quantitative attitudes in the segment (e.g., support for local businesses at 16%) are lower than average, but this is not directly related to energy-saving. No evidence suggests a need for demographic calibration. Therefore, the general template for this concept is applied. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the well-calibrated baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but with a strong behavioral component and is well-calibrated in V4 (no systematic error, so use the general template: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%). The segment 'Upmarket Families' is affluent, likely to be environmentally aware, and the baseline for this item is already high (70% agreement). No direct quantitative evidence for this specific item, but the segment's profile (high outgoings, moderate digital engagement, some local business support) does not suggest a need to adjust the baseline. No demographic calibration is needed as the concept is well-calibrated and the segment is not an outlier for this item. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is classified as a low-friction behavior, but V4 guidance specifies this item is well-calibrated and should retain the V3 baseline (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%). The segment 'Upmarket Families' shows no evidence of systematically higher or lower agreement on similar attitudes (e.g., only 16% agree with 'I make an effort to support local businesses'), but this is a different domain and not directly comparable. No quantitative evidence suggests deviation from the general population for this specific energy-saving behavior. Therefore, the general template is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with V4 evidence hierarchy and well-calibrated historical performance for this concept.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is classified as an attitude. According to the V4 baseline, this concept is well-calibrated and should retain the V3 values: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment 'Upmarket Families' shows no direct evidence to suggest deviation from the baseline: their digital attitudes and support for local businesses are moderate, but not strongly indicative of higher or lower environmental or cost-saving behaviors. No demographic calibration is needed, as this segment is affluent and the baseline already reflects general population variance. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the well-calibrated baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the most relevant quantitative anchor ('Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 49%) but correctly notes that this is a broader and more positively framed item than the restrictive 'most important feature' statement. The V4 cross-class correction (-5pp from V3) is appropriately prioritized, and the demographic calibration for Upmarket Families is correctly judged as minimal (+2pp, not enough to override the concept-specific correction). The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the repeated application of the V4 template is justified by both the quantitative data and the methodological guidance. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchoring, robust cross-class correction, and clear alignment with the evidence provided. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 25.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' The most relevant quantitative anchor is the action: 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.49), which is related but not identical—environmental concern is broader than fuel economy, but the overlap is significant. V4's cross-class analysis shows that for this concept, V3 over-predicted by +5pp, so the corrected baseline is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The Upmarket Families segment is affluent and likely to care somewhat more about environmental/fuel issues, but the demographic calibration for high income is only +2pp in V4 (down from +5pp in V3), so the effect is minimal. The direct evidence (0.49) is higher than the V4 baseline, but the question is broader and likely inflates agreement compared to the more restrictive 'most important feature.' Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, with no further upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchoring and robust cross-class correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' According to V4, this is a high-friction attitude with a history of over-prediction (+5pp bias in V3), so the corrected baseline is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). 

The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 49%. However, this is a broader and more positively framed item than 'fuel consumption is the most important feature,' which is more restrictive and likely to have lower agreement. The next most relevant evidence is much lower (well insured: 13%). 

Given the V4 cross-class correction (-5pp from V3), and the fact that the Upmarket Families segment is affluent but not especially eco-centric, the baseline is appropriate. No strong demographic up-weighting is justified (affluent classes get only +2pp in V4, which is not enough to shift the baseline template). 

Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong cross-class consistency and the lack of evidence suggesting a higher agreement for this restrictive statement.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the V4 prompt specifies a concept-specific correction: for this item, V3 over-predicted by +5pp, so the V4 baseline is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.49), which is higher than the V4 baseline, but this is a broader environmental concern, not specifically fuel consumption as the single most important feature. The other evidence (attitudes about energy companies, insurance, pet care) is less directly relevant. Upmarket Families may be slightly more likely than average to care about environmental/fuel issues, but the V4 demographic calibration for high income is only +2pp, and the concept-specific correction dominates. Therefore, I use the V4 corrected baseline for this concept, with no further upward adjustment, as the evidence does not strongly justify it. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchoring and clear V4 guidance.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the V4 template and cross-class analysis treat it as a high-friction behavior/priority (since 'most important' is a strong claim). The closest quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 49% (likely agreement), but this is a broader, less exclusive criterion than 'fuel consumption is the most important feature.' V4's cross-class correction for this concept is to REDUCE by -5pp from V3, due to systematic over-prediction. The V4 template for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). This is lower than the 49% for 'environmentally friendly' because 'most important' is a much higher bar, and the evidence hierarchy prioritizes the V4 correction over the segment's slightly higher environmental concern. Demographic calibration for 'Upmarket Families' (affluent, likely more environmentally aware) would add +2pp, but V4 reduces demographic adjustments by 50%, so the effect is minimal and does not override the cross-class correction. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors and robust V4 correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about fuel consumption being the most important feature when buying a new car. V4 guidance for this concept is to use the 'Fuel consumption important when buying car' template, which is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), after correcting for a systematic +5pp over-prediction in V3. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.49), which is higher than the V4 baseline, but this is a broader environmental concern, not specifically fuel consumption as the single most important feature. The other evidence (attitudes about energy companies, insurance, pet care) is less relevant. Upmarket Families may be slightly more likely to care about environmental/fuel issues, but the V4 demographic calibration for affluent classes is now only +2pp, and the concept-specific correction dominates. Therefore, I use the V4 corrected baseline for this concept, with no further upward adjustment, as the evidence does not strongly support a higher agreement. Confidence is high due to strong template alignment and relevant quantitative anchor.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified. The rationale across all runs consistently references the V4 baseline, which is described as well-calibrated for this concept (error < 1pp), and there is no direct or indirect evidence from the provided quantitative toplines that would warrant deviation from this baseline. The segment (Upmarket Families) shows moderate risk tolerance and no extreme attitudes in the other domains, supporting the use of the general population template. The evidence selection rationale is appropriate, and the confidence in the estimate is high due to the strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and lack of contradictory data. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), which is well-calibrated in V4 and should use the standard template: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The provided quantitative evidence (e.g., only 13% help out in the community, 28% see climate change as the biggest threat) suggests moderate agreement with pro-social or risk-averse attitudes, but nothing indicates a strong deviation from the general population on debt aversion. Upmarket Families are typically financially stable but not uniquely debt-averse compared to other affluent groups. No demographic calibration is needed, as this concept is already well-calibrated and the evidence does not suggest a need for adjustment. Confidence is high due to direct alignment with the V4 template and lack of conflicting evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude statement. According to the V4 baseline for this concept (which is well-calibrated and should not be adjusted), the expected agreement is 43% (SA 18%, A 25%). The provided quantitative evidence does not directly address debt aversion, but the segment (Upmarket Families) shows moderate risk tolerance (32% agree to risk-taking with money) and moderate concern for climate change (28% agreement). These suggest a balanced, not extreme, attitude profile. There is no evidence of unusually high or low debt aversion in this segment, so the general population baseline is appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to the well-calibrated baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), so the V4 attitude baseline applies: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, this concept is specifically listed as 'well-calibrated' in V4 (error < 1pp), so the V3 values are retained: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence from this segment (Upmarket Families) does not directly address debt aversion, but the segment's moderate risk tolerance (32% agree to risk-taking with money) and moderate concern for climate change (28% agree it's the biggest threat) suggest a balanced, not extreme, attitude profile. No evidence suggests a need to adjust the well-calibrated baseline. Therefore, the V3 distribution is used, with high confidence due to direct alignment with the evidence hierarchy and V4 guidance.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), so the V4 attitude baseline applies: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, this concept is one of the four that are well-calibrated in V3 (error < 1pp), so the V3 distribution is retained: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. No strong demographic calibration is warranted for 'Upmarket Families'—this group is affluent but not extreme on debt aversion, and no direct evidence in the provided toplines contradicts the baseline. The available quantitative evidence (risk-taking, climate concern, community help) does not directly relate to debt attitudes, so the general template is most appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude statement. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the baseline: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The provided quantitative evidence (e.g., low community helping, moderate climate concern, moderate risk tolerance) does not indicate a strong deviation from the general population for this attitude. Upmarket Families may have slightly higher financial confidence, but there is no direct evidence suggesting they are less averse to debt. Therefore, the general V4 baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to the well-calibrated nature of this item and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run is consistent and well-grounded in the provided evidence and methodological guidance. The use of the V4 baseline for identity statements, with the concept-specific correction for 'good at managing money', is appropriate given the lack of direct quantitative evidence for higher or lower self-assessment in this segment. The demographic calibration for high income is acknowledged and correctly applied at a reduced strength, in line with V4 guidance. The quantitative evidence (e.g., online savings management, private car ownership, miscellaneous spending) supports the segment's financial competence but does not warrant further adjustment. The qualitative profile does not contradict the baseline. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and calibration logic. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 34.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.84 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is classified as an identity statement. The V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), which already incorporates a -6pp correction from V3 due to moderate over-prediction. The segment, 'Upmarket Families', is affluent and likely to have higher financial confidence, but V4 demographic calibrations are now reduced by 50% (from +5pp to +2pp for high income). However, since the baseline is already relatively high and the correction is applied, and because the evidence (e.g., high online savings management, high private car ownership) supports financial competence, no further upward adjustment is warranted. The distribution remains at the V4 baseline for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment characteristics and the identity statement, and because the V4 correction is already applied.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'identity' (self-assessment of money management skill). V4 baseline for 'good at managing money' is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3 due to systematic over-prediction. Upmarket Families are affluent, with high rates of private car ownership (89.5%), high miscellaneous spending, and moderate online savings management (35%). These indicators suggest financial competence and confidence, but not universal digital engagement. No direct quantitative evidence on self-rated money management, so default to V4 baseline for this concept. Demographic calibration for high income is +2pp, but V4 reduces demographic adjustments by 50%, so the baseline is appropriate without further upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment profile and concept type, and the use of a well-calibrated V4 template.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for this concept is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3 due to a consistent +6pp over-prediction. For 'Upmarket Families', there is some evidence of higher financial engagement (e.g., 35% manage savings online, high spending on miscellaneous goods/services, high car ownership), but these do not directly indicate a higher self-assessment of money management skill. Demographic calibration for high income is +2pp, but V4 reduces the strength of this adjustment. Given the lack of direct quantitative evidence for higher or lower self-assessment, and the V4 guidance to keep the identity baseline with only minor demographic adjustment, the best estimate is to use the V4 corrected baseline for identity concepts. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and V4 calibration.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity concepts is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, for this specific concept, V4 applies a moderate correction (-6pp from V3) due to systematic over-prediction, resulting in SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). The segment 'Upmarket Families' is affluent, but demographic calibration is now reduced by 50% (from +5pp to +2pp), which is not enough to shift the distribution further given the concept-specific correction already applied. Quantitative evidence (e.g., high spending on miscellaneous goods, high rate of private car ownership) supports financial competence but does not directly indicate self-perceived money management skill. The qualitative profile does not contradict the baseline. Therefore, the V4 corrected identity baseline for this concept is used. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and moderate demographic adjustment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity concepts is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, the concept-specific correction for 'good at managing money' is to reduce agreement by 6pp from V3, resulting in SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). 

For Upmarket Families, there is no strong evidence to further increase or decrease agreement: 
- The segment is affluent and likely to have higher financial confidence, but V4 demographic calibrations are now reduced by 50% (high income: +2pp). 
- Quantitative evidence (e.g., 35% manage savings online) suggests moderate financial engagement, but not exceptionally high. 
- No direct evidence of self-rated money management skill, so the concept-specific correction is most appropriate.

Therefore, the V4 corrected identity template for this concept is applied, with a slight upward nudge (+2pp) for high income, but this is already reflected in the concept-specific correction. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class evidence and well-calibrated correction.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the V4 baseline for a well-calibrated attitude item, and the available quantitative evidence (notably the low agreement with 'fuel consumption is the most important feature') supports a low agreement estimate for 'It is important to be well insured for everything.' There is no qualitative or demographic evidence to suggest a deviation from the baseline. The repeated application of the template and explicit mention of the lack of segment-specific evidence further strengthen the justification. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to the V4 baseline, this concept is well-calibrated and should not be adjusted from V3: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The quantitative evidence from the segment (Upmarket Families) shows low agreement with similar 'responsibility' or 'importance' attitudes (e.g., only 12% agree that fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car), suggesting a pragmatic but not overly risk-averse or insurance-focused mindset. No strong qualitative evidence is present to override the baseline. Demographic calibration is not applied as the baseline is already well-calibrated and the evidence does not suggest a higher agreement. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative alignment and cross-class calibration.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is an attitude item. According to the V4 prompt, this concept is well-calibrated in V3 and should be left unchanged: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The direct quantitative evidence for a similar 'importance' attitude (fuel consumption as most important feature when buying a car) is low (0.12), suggesting that this segment (Upmarket Families) does not strongly prioritize single features as 'most important.' There is no evidence in the qualitative notes to suggest a higher or lower baseline for insurance attitudes. Therefore, the V4 template for this concept is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and strong cross-class calibration for this concept.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is an attitude item. V4 guidance says this concept is well-calibrated in V3, so we use the V3 template: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The only relevant quantitative evidence is for a similar attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', value=0.12), which is low and supports a low agreement estimate. No qualitative evidence suggests unusually high or low insurance concern for this segment. No demographic calibration is needed (Upmarket Families are affluent, but V4 reduces demographic adjustments by 50%, and insurance attitudes are well-calibrated). Therefore, the baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and strong template fit.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to the V4 prompt, this item is among the 'well-calibrated' concepts, so the baseline template from V3 is retained: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The direct quantitative evidence for a similar 'attitude' item ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is 0.12 (12%), which is in line with the low agreement baseline for this type of high-friction, risk-averse attitude among upmarket families. No qualitative evidence suggests a higher or lower weighting for insurance importance in this segment. Therefore, the default V4 distribution is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative alignment and the concept being well-calibrated in prior rounds.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to the V4 prompt, this item is among the 'well-calibrated' concepts, so the baseline template is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence for this segment (Upmarket Families) shows low prioritization for fuel consumption (0.12) and moderate attention to mass market clothing (0.57), but there is no direct evidence suggesting a higher or lower valuation of insurance. The demographic is likely affluent, but the V4 demographic calibration for high income is now only +2pp, which is not enough to shift the baseline template meaningfully. Therefore, the well-calibrated baseline is retained. Confidence is high due to direct alignment with the V4 template and lack of strong segment-specific evidence to adjust.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes among 'Upmarket Families' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the strong quantitative evidence: only 1% vegan, 5% vegetarian, 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, and 73% meat-eaters, which supports the conclusion that actual dietary change is limited. The application of the V4 correction for systematic over-prediction is methodologically sound, and the lack of strong qualitative or demographic evidence to override this correction is appropriately noted. The repeated application of the same corrected topline across runs, with high confidence and explicit reference to the evidence and correction protocol, demonstrates robust methodological alignment. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 26.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this item due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is now 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan, 5% vegetarian, and 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 73% eating meat. This suggests that while some may value healthy eating, actual dietary change is limited, supporting a lower agreement rate. No qualitative evidence contradicts this. Demographic calibration is not applied as 'Upmarket Families' do not show a strong deviation from the general population for this concept. The distribution follows the V4 corrected template for 'Healthy Eating'. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and robust cross-class correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude), for 'Upmarket Families'. V4 mandates a major correction for 'Healthy Eating' due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is now: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14% (38% agreement). Quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 5% vegetarian, 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, and 73% eat meat, indicating that while some healthy eating behaviors are present, the majority are not following restrictive or highly health-oriented diets. This supports the lower agreement baseline. No strong qualitative evidence is present to override this. Demographic calibration for 'Upmarket Families' (affluent, likely slightly higher health orientation) would normally add +2pp, but V4's cross-class correction dominates. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and robust V4 correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude), which V4 identifies as systematically over-predicted in all classes and corrects by -22pp from the V3 baseline. The quantitative evidence shows that the vast majority of 'Upmarket Families' eat meat (73%), with only 1% vegan, 5% vegetarian, and 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while there may be some awareness or aspiration toward healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. The V4 correction for 'Healthy Eating' is specifically designed to address this over-prediction, so the corrected distribution (SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%) is applied. The confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and the cross-class consistency of the correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3 across all classes), so the baseline is set at 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows that the vast majority of 'Upmarket Families' eat meat (73%), with only 1% vegan, 5% vegetarian, and 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while there may be some awareness or aspiration toward healthy eating, actual dietary behavior is not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. However, the concept is attitudinal, not behavioral, so some positive sentiment is still expected. No strong demographic calibration is warranted (affluent, but not a high-consistency error class). Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong cross-class evidence and supporting quantitative data.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude), for the 'Upmarket Families' segment. V4 mandates a -22pp correction for 'Healthy Eating' due to systematic over-prediction in all classes. The quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 5% vegetarian, 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, and 73% meat-eaters, indicating that while some diversity exists, the vast majority are not following the strictest healthy eating patterns. However, 'Healthy Eating' as an attitude is typically higher than actual restrictive dietary behaviors, but the evidence suggests only moderate agreement. Therefore, I apply the V4 corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' (SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%), with no upward demographic calibration (Upmarket Families are affluent, but the evidence does not support a higher agreement). Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and robust cross-class correction.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 attitude baseline for the concept 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility,' which is appropriate given the nature of the statement and the segment ('Upmarket Families'). The quantitative evidence (e.g., 16% plan to use other investments for retirement, 24% only save for a specific purpose) is correctly interpreted as indicating moderate, but not unusually high, proactive retirement planning. The demographic calibration is applied cautiously, in line with V4 guidance, and not over-weighted given the evidence. There is no contradictory evidence, and the topline estimate (60% agreement, distributed as 25/35/18/13/9) is well supported by both the template and the available data. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.00%
  Slightly disagree: 13.00%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 attitude baseline applies. The segment is 'Upmarket Families', a relatively affluent, financially literate group, which would typically score slightly above baseline on personal responsibility attitudes. However, the most relevant quantitative evidence ('Plans to use other investments for retirement' = 16%) suggests relatively low proactive planning for retirement beyond standard means, and 'I only save for a specific purpose' is also low (24%). These suggest that while the group may endorse the principle of personal responsibility, actual proactive behavior is less common. V4's cross-class correction for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is -3pp from V3, so the template is SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). Demographic calibration for affluent classes is +2pp, but V4 reduces this by 50% (so +1pp), but the quantitative evidence is weak, so I do not apply the full demographic uplift. The final estimate is the V4 corrected template for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong template calibration and moderate quantitative support.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is used: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this affluent segment (Upmarket Families) shows moderate engagement with retirement planning (16% plan to use other investments for retirement), but this is not directly about responsibility. Other attitudes (e.g., 24% only save for a specific purpose, 34% agree switching utilities is worth the effort) suggest a pragmatic, self-reliant mindset, but not an unusually high sense of personal responsibility for retirement. No evidence justifies deviating from the V4 baseline. Demographic calibration for affluent classes is +2pp, but V4 reduces this by 50%, so only +1pp would apply—however, the baseline is already high (60%), and the evidence does not support further upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the V4 template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is used: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). The quantitative evidence from this affluent segment (Upmarket Families) shows relatively low intent to use other investments for retirement (16%), but this is about behavior, not attitude. No direct evidence contradicts the baseline, and affluent segments typically show slightly higher agreement with self-reliance attitudes, but V4 demographic calibrations are now minimal (+2pp at most). The well-calibrated V4 baseline is therefore appropriate, with no strong reason to adjust up or down. Confidence is high due to the direct match between concept and template, and the absence of conflicting evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but closely related to identity for this affluent, financially literate segment ('Upmarket Families'). V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is 25/35/18/13/9 (60% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3. Quantitative evidence is limited but relevant: only 16% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting most expect to self-fund or use pensions), and 24% only save for a specific purpose (implying some proactive financial planning). The segment's high trust in price comparison sites (55%) and moderate agreement that switching utilities is worth the effort (34%) indicate financial engagement and self-reliance. No evidence suggests a need for further upward or downward calibration for this affluent group, so the V4 baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong segment fit and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but closely borders on 'identity' for affluent, responsible segments like Upmarket Families. V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is 25/35/18/13/9 (60% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3 due to prior over-prediction. Quantitative evidence is limited but does not contradict this: only 16% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting most expect to self-fund or rely on pensions), and 24% only save for a specific purpose (implying a majority may have broader saving habits, consistent with personal responsibility). No evidence suggests a lower sense of responsibility than the general population. Demographic calibration for affluent classes is +2pp, but V4 reduces this by 50%, so the baseline is appropriate without further upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with both the concept type and available evidence.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run consistently references the evidence hierarchy: the concept is a well-calibrated attitude with a stable general population baseline, and the quantitative evidence (high outgoings on utilities, council tax, etc.) is relevant but not sufficient to warrant deviation from this baseline. There is no qualitative or quantitative evidence indicating that 'Upmarket Families' have systematically different attitudes toward switching utilities. The evidence selection is balanced, and the application of the V4 protocol is appropriate. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence (high outgoings on utilities, council tax, etc.) suggests this segment is engaged with household management, but there is no direct evidence of higher switching propensity or attitudes. The qualitative notes do not indicate a strong deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the general population baseline is appropriate, with no demographic calibration needed for 'Upmarket Families' (affluent, but not shown to be systematically different on this attitude). Confidence is high due to direct alignment with well-calibrated baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should retain the V3 baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. The segment (Upmarket Families) shows high outgoings on utilities, which could slightly increase engagement, but the V4 protocol maintains the general baseline unless there is strong segment-specific evidence. The quantitative data (high utility spend) is relevant but not sufficient to warrant deviation from the well-calibrated baseline. No qualitative evidence suggests a strong deviation. Therefore, the standard V4 distribution is applied with high confidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'). According to V4, this is a well-calibrated concept, so we use the V3 baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related bills, which may indicate awareness of utility costs, but does not directly suggest higher agreement with switching effort being worthwhile. No qualitative evidence suggests unusually high or low motivation to switch. Upmarket Families are not especially constrained or transient, so no demographic calibration is needed. Therefore, the general V4 baseline for this attitude is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative relevance and strong baseline calibration.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to the V4 baseline for this concept (which is well-calibrated and unchanged from V3), the expected distribution is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence shows that 'Upmarket Families' have significant outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related bills, which could make them more attentive to potential savings from switching. However, there is no direct evidence of higher switching rates or stronger attitudes toward switching in this segment, and the baseline is already well-calibrated. Therefore, no demographic calibration is applied. The qualitative notes do not provide additional relevant context. The prediction maintains the V4 baseline for this attitude concept, with high confidence due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and calibration guidance.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated in the general population (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence for 'Upmarket Families' shows high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related expenses, which could suggest a moderate incentive to consider switching for savings. However, there is no direct evidence of higher switching rates or stronger attitudes toward switching in this segment. The demographic calibration for affluent classes is minimal (+2pp), but since the concept is already well-calibrated and the evidence does not strongly indicate higher agreement, I retain the V4 baseline. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the absence of segment-specific deviation.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the quantitative toplines, which show moderate online purchase rates for Upmarket Families—lower for everyday items, higher for infrequent/larger purchases. This supports the use of the V4 baseline for the 'like to use cash' attitude, as there is no strong evidence for either a higher or lower cash preference in this segment. The qualitative profile does not contradict this. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the lack of demographic outlier status is correctly noted. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 24.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For Upmarket Families, quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 26%, pet care 18%), but higher for larger/less frequent purchases (home appliances 53%, holidays 63%). This suggests moderate digital adoption for essentials, but not universal. V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is 13/24/28/22/13 (37% agreement), which fits the evidence: this segment is not especially cash-preferring, but not fully digital either. No strong demographic calibration is needed (Upmarket Families are not especially cash-oriented or cash-averse). No direct anchor, so use V4 baseline. Confidence is high due to relevant quantitative evidence and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For V4, the general baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate but not high preference for cash. The quantitative evidence shows that Upmarket Families have relatively high online purchase rates for home appliances (53%) and holiday/travel (63%), but much lower for alcohol (26%) and pet care (18%). This suggests a mixed but overall moderate adoption of digital payments, with a likely lower-than-average preference for cash compared to the general population, but not extremely low. The qualitative profile for Upmarket Families does not indicate a strong cash preference. No strong demographic calibration is warranted (affluent, but not extreme outlier). Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, and no further adjustment is needed. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors and well-calibrated V4 baseline.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For Upmarket Families, quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items like alcohol (26%) and pet care (18%), but much higher for home appliances (53%) and holidays/travel (63%). This suggests a moderate but not strong preference for digital/online transactions, with some openness to cash for routine purchases. The V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is 13/24/28/22/13 (37% agreement), and there is no strong evidence to adjust this up or down for this affluent segment, as their online adoption is mixed by category. No demographic calibration is warranted. The estimate maintains the V4 baseline for this attitude, with moderate confidence due to the mixed quantitative signals.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude.' V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate but not high preference for cash. Quantitative evidence from Upmarket Families shows relatively low online purchase rates for alcohol (26%) and pet care (18%), but much higher for home appliances (53%) and holiday/travel (63%). This suggests that while online purchasing is common for larger or less frequent purchases, everyday items may still involve in-person/cash transactions, but overall, this segment is digitally engaged. No strong evidence to deviate from V4 baseline. Demographic calibration for Upmarket Families (affluent, digitally engaged) would suggest a slight downward adjustment, but V4 reduces demographic adjustments by 50%, so the baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For Upmarket Families, the quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items like alcoholic drinks (26%) and pet care (18%), but higher for home appliances (53%) and holidays/travel (63%). This suggests a moderate adoption of online purchasing, but not a strong preference for cash. The V4 baseline for this attitude is 13% strongly agree, 24% slightly agree, 28% neither, 22% slightly disagree, 13% strongly disagree (37% agreement). No strong demographic correction is warranted for Upmarket Families, as their online adoption is mixed and the class is not especially cash-oriented. The evidence hierarchy is led by direct quantitative data (online purchase rates), which moderately suggest a move away from cash for some categories but not all. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, with moderate confidence.
