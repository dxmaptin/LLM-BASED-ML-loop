### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.77
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale clearly explains that the quantitative evidence (current account management by phone, country of birth) is only weakly relevant to the target 'attitude' concept, and that no direct evidence exists for the specific attitude in question. The use of a generic attitude or environmental virtue signaling baseline is appropriate in the absence of more specific data, and the distribution applied (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is consistent with established baselines for low-agreement attitudes. The confidence level is appropriately moderate-high, reflecting the indirect but non-contradictory nature of the evidence. No revision is required unless more directly relevant evidence becomes available.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is labeled as 'attitude' with no further detail, so I must default to semantic category classification. The provided quantitative evidence is about current account management by phone (values 0.12 and 0.03), and country of birth (values 0.01 and 0.02), all with moderate relevance but not directly about the target concept. These low values suggest low agreement for the behaviors/attitudes measured. In the absence of direct evidence for the specific attitude, and given the lack of cost-saving, self-reliance, or risk-aversion cues, I classify this as a generic attitude or possibly environmental virtue signaling (if the attitude is about a social good), both of which have low agreement baselines (30-35%). I use the Environmental Virtue Signaling baseline (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) as the most conservative fit, since the evidence hints at low engagement/agreement. Confidence is moderate-high due to the alignment of indirect evidence with the low-agreement baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is labeled as 'attitude' with no further detail, so the semantic category defaults to 'Generic Attitude' unless more context is provided. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account by phone' at 12%, 'Arrange current account by phone' at 3%) is low and only weakly relevant, suggesting low behavioral uptake for related actions, but these are not direct attitude measures. No evidence strongly contradicts the baseline for generic attitudes (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). No demographic calibration is warranted as the evidence is not specific to a group with strong deviation. Confidence is moderate-high due to the lack of direct, high-relevance evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target is a generic 'attitude' concept with no further detail, so the semantic category defaults to 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' or generic attitude (30% agreement baseline). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account by phone' at 12%, 'Arrange current account by phone' at 3%) is low and only weakly relevant (relevance <0.8), suggesting low behavioral uptake for related actions. No evidence suggests this is a cost-consciousness or self-reliance item. Therefore, the baseline for generic attitude (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is applied. Confidence is moderate-high due to clear category fit and lack of strong contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept is labeled as 'attitude' with no further specifics, so I default to semantic category classification. None of the quantitative evidence is highly relevant to a specific attitude concept (most relates to country of birth or phone banking, not attitudes). In the absence of more detail, I use the 'Generic Attitude' baseline, which closely matches the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' category (30% agreement) due to the lack of behavioral or cost-saving cues. The distribution is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. No demographic calibration is applied due to lack of specific context. Confidence is moderate because the evidence is not directly relevant to the concept.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target is a generic 'attitude' concept with no further detail, so the semantic category defaults to 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' or generic attitude (30% agreement baseline). The quantitative evidence provided is about country of birth and phone banking preferences, but none are directly relevant to the concept itself (relevance <0.8 for all, and the highest is 0.80 but not concept-specific). No evidence suggests this is a cost-consciousness, self-reliance, or expensive purchase item. Therefore, the generic attitude baseline is used: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is moderate-high due to lack of specific concept detail and only weakly relevant evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.93
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most directly relevant quantitative evidence: only 9% of upmarket families consider themselves environmentalists, and only 24% think energy companies do not care about the environment. These figures indicate low salience of environmental attitudes, supporting the use of the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' category baseline (30% agreement). The distribution is not adjusted upward, and the reasoning for not applying demographic calibration is sound given the evidence. The repeated rationales are consistent, transparent, and grounded in the provided data. Confidence is high due to the strong alignment between the topline estimate and the evidence hierarchy. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). The strongest quantitative evidence is that only 9% of this segment (upmarket families) consider themselves environmentalists, and only 24% think energy companies do not care about the environment—both indicating relatively low environmental concern or identification. There is no evidence of higher engagement or pro-environmental attitudes in this segment. Thus, the baseline is not adjusted upward. No demographic calibration is warranted, as upmarket families are not especially urban or progressive in the evidence provided. The distribution reflects the typical attitudinal gap: many are neutral or slightly disagree, with a minority agreeing. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA+A). The strongest quantitative evidence is that only 9% of this segment (upmarket families) consider themselves environmentalists, and only 24% think energy companies do not care about the environment—both indicating low salience of environmental attitudes in this group. There is no evidence of strong pro-environmental sentiment, and the segment is likely pragmatic and status-oriented. Therefore, the baseline is not raised, and if anything, the evidence suggests the agreement may be at the lower end of the category. The distribution is thus set at the category baseline, with a slight tilt toward more disagreement, reflecting the segment's low environmental identification. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events') is an environmental attitude, not a behavior, so it fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category (baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). This is strongly supported by the quantitative evidence: only 9% of this segment (upmarket families) consider themselves environmentalists, and only 24% agree that energy companies do not care about the environment—both indicating low salience of environmental attitudes in this group. No evidence suggests higher agreement. Demographic calibration for 'upmarket families' (likely higher income, possibly urban) could add +3pp, but the direct evidence is so low that the baseline is already generous. Therefore, the category baseline is maintained, and the evidence hierarchy (direct quantitative > category) supports a low agreement estimate. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.95 / Rationale: The target concept ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events') is an environmental attitude, not a behavior, so it fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category (baseline: 8% SA, 22% A, 30% N, 25% D, 15% SD). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows very low agreement with environmentalist identity (9%) and low agreement that energy companies don't care about the environment (24%), both well below even the already-low category baseline. This suggests that even among upmarket families, environmental attitudes are weak. No evidence suggests higher agreement. Therefore, I use the category baseline without upward calibration, and the direct evidence supports keeping agreement at the low end. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows very low self-identification as environmentalists (9%) and low distrust of energy companies' environmental care (24%), both indicating even lower environmental concern than the general population. There is no evidence of strong pro-environmental attitudes in this group. Therefore, the baseline is not increased and may even be slightly conservative. No demographic calibration is needed, as 'upmarket families' are not especially more or less environmentally focused than the general population. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.91
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently and appropriately grounds the high agreement rates in the strong quantitative evidence of high outgoings on housing and utilities (93.18%), which is highly relevant to the target concept of making efforts to cut down on gas/electricity use. The attitudinal and digital evidence is correctly identified as not directly relevant, and the demographic calibration is handled with appropriate caution, noting that cost-saving is a universal motivator. The repeated use of a high baseline for 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' is well-supported by the evidence provided. The confidence in the estimate is warranted given the strong category fit and the highly relevant quantitative data.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 31.60%
  Slightly agree: 39.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 14.20%
  Slightly disagree: 9.80%
  Strongly disagree: 5.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=9.00%, Strongly disagree=6.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is a classic example of a 'Cost-Consciousness Behavior' (Category 1), which typically sees high agreement (~70%) because saving on utility bills is a universal motivator, especially for upmarket families with high outgoings on housing and utilities (quantitative evidence: 93% report significant outgoings in this area). There is no evidence of strong attitudinal or behavioral resistance in the segment; digital attitudes and support for local businesses are much lower, but these are unrelated. Demographic calibration for 'upmarket families' (higher income) suggests a slight increase in agreement (+3pp), but the baseline is already high. The final estimate is slightly above the category baseline, reflecting both the universal cost-saving motive and the segment's high utility spend. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving on utility bills is a universal, low-effort, money-saving action. The quantitative evidence shows that this segment ('upmarket families') has very high outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels (93.18), which further incentivizes efforts to reduce these costs. There is no direct evidence contradicting this pattern, and the segment's digital/financial attitudes are not directly relevant. Demographic calibration for 'upmarket' (higher income) could slightly increase agreement, but since the baseline is already high, only a minor adjustment is warranted. The final estimate is slightly above the category baseline, reflecting both the universal appeal and the segment's high exposure to these costs. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving on utility bills is a universal, low-effort, high-reward behavior. The quantitative evidence shows that this segment ('upmarket families') has very high outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels (93.18), indicating that energy costs are salient and likely to motivate efforts to reduce usage. There is no evidence of strong environmental virtue signaling or effort aversion in this segment, and the demographic (upmarket families) does not require a significant calibration (high income may slightly increase agreement, but the baseline is already high). The other attitude items provided are unrelated or much lower in agreement, but they do not contradict the high baseline for cost-saving behaviors. Therefore, the estimate is slightly above the category baseline, with high confidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is a classic example of a 'Cost-Consciousness Behavior' (Category 1), which typically sees high agreement (~70%) because saving on utility bills is a universal motivator, especially for 'upmarket families' who have significant outgoings on housing and utilities (quantitative evidence: 93% report high outgoings in this area). There is no evidence of strong environmental virtue signaling or effort aversion that would lower agreement. The segment's digital attitudes and local business support are not directly relevant. Demographic calibration for 'upmarket families' (higher income) is neutral here, as cost-saving is universal. The estimate is slightly above the category baseline due to the very high relevance of utility outgoings in this segment. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and quantitative support.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category. This category is characterized by high agreement (baseline ~70%) because saving money on unavoidable household expenses is a universal priority, especially for upmarket families with high outgoings on housing and utilities (quantitative evidence: 93% report significant spending here). There is no evidence of strong environmental virtue signaling or effort aversion that would lower agreement. Demographic calibration for 'upmarket families' (higher income) does not significantly alter the baseline for this category, as cost-saving is universally valued. The quantitative evidence is highly relevant and supports the high baseline. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently recognizes the semantic distinction between 'important' and 'most important,' and correctly identifies that the available quantitative evidence (49% rating 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' as important) is related but not directly equivalent to the target concept. The baseline for 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' is appropriately referenced, and the modest upward calibration is well-argued given the segment's characteristics. The repeated rationales demonstrate a clear, methodical approach, and the final distribution is plausible and well-supported by the evidence. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 7.00%
  Slightly agree: 18.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 27.00%
  Strongly disagree: 20.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') fits the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15-20%) because it requires prioritizing a specific feature (fuel consumption) over others in a high-cost context. The most relevant quantitative evidence is that 49% of this segment rate 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' as important when buying a car, which is related but not identical—environmental concern is not the same as cost/fuel concern, and 'most important' is a higher bar than 'important.' The baseline for 'Expensive Purchases' is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%. Given the upmarket family segment (likely higher income), a small upward calibration (+8pp) is justified, but the evidence does not support a majority prioritizing fuel consumption above all else. The distribution is thus slightly more positive than the baseline but still shows a majority not agreeing. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, as it refers to a high-cost decision and prioritization among features. The closest quantitative evidence is the 0.49 agreement for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' being important when buying a car, but this is a different (though related) value—environmental concern, not cost-saving per se. The baseline for 'Expensive Purchases' is low (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%), reflecting that few people cite a single feature as 'most important' in a major purchase. However, fuel consumption is a practical, cost-related concern, which may slightly elevate agreement among upmarket families (who may be more cost-conscious about running costs, but also value other features like safety, brand, or tech). The evidence does not suggest a strong shift from baseline, so a modest upward adjustment is made (SA 7%, A 18%) but the majority remain neutral or disagree. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is best classified as 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' (category 5), since it refers to a high-cost decision and prioritization among features. The baseline for this category is low agreement (~15%) because most buyers consider multiple factors (price, brand, safety, etc.), not just fuel consumption. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.49), which is related but not identical—environmental concern is not the same as cost/fuel efficiency, though there is overlap. This 49% is much higher than the baseline, but it refers to 'important' (not 'most important') and to a different feature (environmental/CO2 vs. fuel cost). The other evidence (insurance, pet care, energy attitudes) is less relevant. Upmarket families may be more able to afford fuel costs, so fuel economy is less likely to be the single most important feature. Therefore, I weight the baseline (15% agreement) upward slightly due to the relatively high importance of environmental/fuel-related features in this segment, but not to the level of the 49% (which is for 'important', not 'most important'). The final estimate is: Strongly agree 7%, Slightly agree 18%, Neither 28%, Slightly disagree 27%, Strongly disagree 20%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, as it concerns a high-cost purchase and prioritization of a specific feature. The baseline for this category is low agreement (~15%) because most people have multiple priorities (price, brand, safety, etc.), and 'most important' is a strong claim. The closest quantitative evidence is that 49% say 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' is important when buying a car, but this is for 'important' (not 'most important'), and environmental concern is generally lower than cost concern. No direct evidence for 'fuel consumption as most important,' but we can infer that while many consider it, few rank it as the top priority. Demographically, upmarket families may be more able to afford higher fuel costs and may prioritize other features (comfort, brand, safety), so no upward calibration. Therefore, the estimate is: Strongly agree 7%, Slightly agree 18%, Neither 28%, Slightly disagree 27%, Strongly disagree 20%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, as it refers to a high-cost decision and prioritization among features. The baseline for this category is low agreement (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). Quantitative evidence shows that only 49% rate 'environmentally friendly/low CO2' as important when buying a car, which is a related but not identical concept; fuel consumption is often correlated but not always the same as environmental friendliness. This 49% is for 'important', not 'most important', so actual agreement with 'most important' will be lower. Other evidence (insurance importance 13%, pet care research 22%) supports that 'most important' features in expensive purchases rarely get high agreement. Upmarket families may be slightly more likely to care about running costs, but also value status, safety, and other features. Therefore, I estimate agreement (SA+A) at 25% (7% SA, 18% A), with a large neutral and disagreement segment. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified based on the evidence provided. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative indicator ('I do not mind taking risks with my money', 32% agreement), which is a strong inverse proxy for debt aversion. The topline evidence is appropriately weighted, and the demographic context (upmarket families) is considered, with a reasonable argument that higher income does not necessarily imply lower debt aversion. The repeated application of the baseline for the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' category is justified, and the distribution reflects moderate risk tolerance. The lack of strong qualitative evidence is acknowledged, but the high relevance and quality of the quantitative evidence compensate for this. No major corrective feedback is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 12.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~43%. This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 32% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting a moderate risk aversion), and the other evidence points to relatively low levels of strong agreement on community or climate attitudes (all below 30%). There is no evidence of unusually high debt aversion or strong anti-debt sentiment in this upmarket segment, so the baseline is appropriate. Demographic calibration for 'upmarket families' (likely higher income) does not significantly shift the baseline for debt aversion, as this group may be more comfortable with debt as a financial tool. Therefore, the estimate remains close to the category baseline, with a moderate spread and slightly higher 'neither' and 'slightly disagree' to reflect the segment's moderate risk tolerance.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~43% (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the segment's moderate risk tolerance (32% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money'), suggesting a slightly higher comfort with risk than average, but not a strong pro-debt attitude. No evidence suggests unusually high or low debt aversion for this segment. Other context (community involvement, climate concern, likelihood to move) is not directly relevant. Therefore, the baseline for debt/risk aversion is applied without major adjustment. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence on risk attitudes.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a moderate baseline agreement (~43%) due to cultural and demographic variation. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (32% agreement), which is a related but inverse attitude; this suggests that a majority are risk-averse, supporting the baseline. Other evidence (helping out in the community, climate change attitudes, likelihood to move) is less directly relevant and does not indicate a strong deviation from the baseline. The segment is 'upmarket families', who may have slightly more comfort with debt due to higher resources, but also may be more financially prudent; these effects likely balance out. Therefore, the baseline distribution for 'Debt/Risk Aversion' is applied with minor calibration. Confidence is high due to strong relevance of the risk attitude evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a moderate baseline agreement (~43%) due to cultural and demographic variation. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (value=0.32, relevance=0.91), which suggests that a minority of this segment are risk-tolerant, implying a moderate but not high aversion to debt. Other evidence (community involvement, climate concern, likelihood to move) is less directly relevant. No strong qualitative evidence is available. Demographically, 'upmarket families' may have slightly less debt aversion than average due to higher financial confidence, but the evidence does not justify a major adjustment. Therefore, the baseline distribution is maintained, with a slight tilt toward neutrality and moderate disagreement, reflecting the segment's moderate risk tolerance.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the segment's moderate risk tolerance (32% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money'), suggesting a somewhat higher comfort with risk than average, but not dramatically so. There is no evidence of unusually high aversion to debt, nor of unusually high risk-seeking. Demographic calibration for 'upmarket families' (likely higher income) does not strongly shift the baseline for debt aversion, as higher income can mean both more access to credit and more financial caution. Therefore, the baseline distribution is applied with high confidence, as the quantitative evidence is relevant but not overriding.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.92
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence and the reasoning provided. The topline quantitative evidence does not directly measure self-assessed money management skill, but the high rates of private car ownership and discretionary spending are reasonable proxies for financial comfort and control, which plausibly support higher self-confidence in money management among 'Upmarket Families.' The rationale for a +3pp calibration above the semantic category baseline is clearly explained and consistently applied across runs. The qualitative notes about the segment further support the adjustment. The moderate online savings management rate is correctly noted as not directly relevant. Overall, the estimate is well-grounded in the evidence and the logic is transparent. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 28.00%
  Slightly agree: 36.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.00%
  Slightly disagree: 11.00%
  Strongly disagree: 7.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=11.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a positive self-assessment of competence, which is subject to social desirability bias and is especially likely to be high among 'Upmarket Families' (higher income, more financial resources, more likely to feel confident about money management). Quantitative evidence is not directly about self-assessed money management skill, but the segment's high spending on miscellaneous goods/services (85.2%) and high private car ownership (89.5%) suggest financial comfort and control, supporting higher self-confidence. The online savings management rate (35%) is moderate, but not directly relevant to self-assessed skill. Demographic calibration: Upmarket Families (high income) get a +3pp boost to agreement. Therefore, I slightly increase the baseline to 64% agreement (28% SA, 36% A), with the remainder distributed as per the category pattern. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supportive segment profile.
Run 2: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=11.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees high agreement (baseline: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%). Upmarket Families are likely to have higher financial literacy and confidence, so a +3pp calibration is justified. Quantitative evidence is not directly about self-assessed money management skill, but high rates of private car ownership (90%) and significant discretionary spending (85% on miscellaneous goods/services) suggest financial comfort and self-assurance. The online savings management rate (35%) is moderate, but not directly indicative of self-perceived skill. Therefore, the estimate is slightly above the category baseline, with a small upward adjustment for affluence and self-confidence typical of this segment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=11.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Self-Reliance Identity. The statement 'I am very good at managing money' is a positive self-concept/competence claim, which typically sees high agreement due to social desirability and self-enhancement bias. The baseline for this category is 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 20% neither, 12% slightly disagree, 8% strongly disagree (60% agreement). Demographic calibration: 'Upmarket Families' are likely to have higher financial confidence and competence, so I add +3pp to agreement. Quantitative evidence is not directly about self-assessed money management skill, but high private car ownership (0.90) and high miscellaneous spending (85.2) suggest financial comfort, supporting higher self-confidence. The online savings management rate (0.35) is moderate, but not directly relevant. Therefore, I slightly increase agreement from baseline. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supportive demographic context.
Run 4: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=11.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees high agreement (baseline: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%). Upmarket Families are likely to have higher financial literacy and confidence, so a +3pp calibration is justified. Quantitative evidence does not directly measure self-assessed money management skill, but the high rate of private car ownership (89.5%) and high miscellaneous spending (85.2%) suggest financial comfort and control, supporting higher self-confidence. The online savings management rate (35%) is moderate, but not directly relevant to self-perceived competence. Therefore, the estimate is slightly above the category baseline, with a small upward adjustment for affluence and self-reliance. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and demographic alignment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=11.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees high agreement (baseline: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%). Upmarket Families are likely to have higher financial confidence and competence, so a +3pp calibration is warranted. Quantitative evidence is not directly about self-assessed money management skill, but the high rate of private car ownership (89.5%) and high miscellaneous spending (85.2%) suggest financial comfort and control, supporting higher self-confidence. The online savings management rate (35%) is moderate, but not directly relevant to self-perceived skill. Thus, I slightly increase agreement from baseline. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supportive demographic context.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.88
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently anchors the prediction to the most relevant and highly weighted quantitative evidence ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', 12% agreement, relevance=0.98), which is a strong proxy for attitudes toward high-cost, risk-mitigation commitments like comprehensive insurance. The semantic mapping to the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' category is appropriate, and the repeated runs demonstrate stability and high confidence in the estimate. The lack of qualitative evidence with high relevance is acknowledged, and the demographic calibration for 'upmarket families' is considered but not over-weighted, which is methodologically sound given the quantitative dominance. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 4.00%
  Slightly agree: 13.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 23.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) due to the cost barrier and the fact that comprehensive insurance is not a universal priority. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the high-relevance topline 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.12, relevance=0.98), which is a similar high-cost, risk-mitigation attitude and shows only 12% agreement. This directly supports a low agreement estimate for the insurance concept. No qualitative evidence suggests a higher baseline. Demographic calibration for 'upmarket families' could slightly increase agreement, but the quantitative evidence is strong and overrides this. Therefore, the estimate is anchored at the evidence-driven level: SA 4%, A 13%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 23%. Confidence is high due to the direct, highly relevant quantitative anchor.
Run 2: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which typically sees low agreement (~15%) due to the high cost and non-universality of comprehensive insurance. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the high-relevance topline 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.12, relevance=0.98), which is a similar high-cost, risk-averse attitude and shows only 12% agreement. This directly supports the baseline for this category (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). The upmarket families segment may have slightly higher resources, but the evidence does not suggest a strong deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline, with a slight nudge towards agreement due to upmarket status, but not enough to shift the overall low-agreement pattern. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which typically sees low agreement (~15%) due to the cost barrier and the fact that comprehensive insurance is not a universal priority. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the high-relevance topline 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.12, relevance=0.98), which is a similar 'expensive commitment' attitude and shows only 12% agreement. This directly supports the category baseline (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). The segment (upmarket families) might be slightly more likely to value insurance, but the evidence does not show a strong deviation from the baseline. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is high due to the direct, highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'It is important to be well insured for everything' involves a costly, comprehensive financial commitment, which typically sees low agreement due to cost barriers and the fact that most people do not prioritize being insured for 'everything.' The closest quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (12% agreement), which is also a high-cost, high-commitment feature, supporting a low baseline. No evidence suggests this segment (upmarket families) is dramatically more insurance-focused than average, so the baseline (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%) is retained. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and clear semantic fit.
Run 5: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'It is important to be well insured for everything' fits this category because it implies a willingness to pay for comprehensive insurance, which is a high-cost, non-universal financial commitment. The baseline for this category is low agreement (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.12, relevance=0.98), which is also a high-cost, risk-averse attitude and shows only 12% agreement, strongly supporting the baseline. Other evidence (adverts, mass market clothing) is less relevant. No strong demographic calibration is warranted for upmarket families, as the evidence suggests even this group is not highly risk-averse or insurance-focused. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently and appropriately links the quantitative evidence (actual eating behaviors) to the attitudinal prediction for 'Healthy Eating.' The topline data show that only a small minority are vegan or vegetarian, with the vast majority eating meat, which supports the conclusion that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual behavioral change is limited. The semantic category baseline (~38% agreement) is applied correctly, and the lack of demographic calibration is justified by the evidence. The confidence is high due to the strong alignment between the quantitative data and the predicted attitude distribution. No major revisions are needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 26.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence provided is about actual eating behaviors (meat, vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian rates) for upmarket families. The high rate of meat-eating (73%) and very low vegan/vegetarian rates (1%/5%) suggest that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary change is limited. This aligns with the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category (~38% agreement), which recognizes an attitude-behavior gap: people may value healthy eating in principle, but fewer act on it. The evidence is highly relevant (relevance >0.9), so it is weighted strongly, supporting a moderate agreement distribution. No major demographic calibration is needed, as upmarket families are not especially more health-oriented in behavior. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is best classified under the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan, 5% vegetarian, and 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 73% eating meat. This indicates that while there is some openness to alternative diets, the vast majority are not making strong health-motivated dietary changes. This supports the baseline: health-conscious attitudes are aspirational but not universally acted upon. No strong demographic calibration is needed for 'upmarket families' as the evidence does not show unusually high health-motivated dietary change. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear category fit.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan, 5% vegetarian, and 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, while 73% eat meat. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. This fits the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category (baseline: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%). The evidence is highly relevant (relevance >0.9), so the baseline is maintained. No strong demographic calibration is needed, as this is already for 'upmarket families' (likely slightly above average, but not enough to shift the baseline). Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence provided is about actual eating behaviors (meat-eating, veganism, vegetarianism, etc.) among upmarket families. The vast majority (73%) eat meat, with only 1% vegan, 5% vegetarian, and 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual adoption of restrictive or health-oriented diets is low. According to the semantic category framework, 'Healthy Eating' falls under Health-Conscious Attitudes (~38% agreement baseline). The quantitative evidence indicates that strong behavioral commitment is rare, so agreement with the attitude is likely moderate, not high. Therefore, the estimate is: Strongly agree 12%, Slightly agree 26%, Neither 26%, Slightly disagree 22%, Strongly disagree 14%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence provided is about actual eating behaviors (e.g., only 0.9% vegan, 5.5% vegetarian, 19.5% pescatarian/flexitarian, and 73% eat meat) for upmarket families. This suggests that while there may be some aspiration or positive attitude toward healthy eating, actual adoption of strict healthy eating behaviors is low. According to the semantic category framework, 'Healthy Eating' as an attitude fits best under 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' (~38% agreement baseline). The quantitative evidence (very low vegan/vegetarian rates) suggests that even among upmarket families, strong commitment to healthy eating is not widespread, so the baseline is appropriate and not increased. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. Therefore, the predicted agreement is moderate, with a distribution reflecting some aspiration but a large neutral/disagree segment.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for agreement with 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the semantic category ('Self-Reliance Identity'), which is empirically associated with high agreement rates (~60%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., low rates of planning to use other investments for retirement, moderate agreement with related financial attitudes) is correctly interpreted as not directly contradicting the baseline expectation for this attitudinal item. The qualitative notes and run-level details show careful consideration of both the direct and indirect relevance of the evidence, and the final distribution is appropriately calibrated for the upmarket families segment. No strong contradictory evidence is present, and the confidence in the estimate is well-supported. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 26.40%
  Slightly agree: 33.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 7.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=26.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a statement about personal responsibility and competence, and such items are generally rated highly due to social desirability and positive self-concept. The most relevant quantitative evidence is from the same segment: 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (0.16) and 'I only save for a specific purpose' (0.24) are both much lower, but these are about specific behaviors or narrower attitudes, not general self-reliance. The closest attitudinal evidence ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 0.34) is about effort, not responsibility, and thus not directly comparable. No evidence strongly contradicts the baseline, so the estimate remains close to the category default: SA 26%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a statement about personal responsibility and competence, and such statements are generally viewed positively due to social desirability bias. The provided quantitative evidence is only weakly related: the closest is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (16%), which is a behavior, not an attitude, and much lower due to the cost/effort barrier. The other evidence ('I only save for a specific purpose', 'I trust financial price comparison sites', 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') is not directly relevant to the self-reliance/retirement responsibility attitude. Therefore, the category baseline (SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%) is most appropriate, with no strong evidence to override it. Upmarket families may be slightly more self-reliant, but the effect is small (+2pp at most), so the baseline is retained. Confidence is high due to clear semantic fit and lack of conflicting evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=27.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category. This category typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). Upmarket families are likely to have higher financial literacy and a stronger sense of personal responsibility, but the quantitative evidence is mixed: only 16% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting reliance on traditional pensions or employer schemes), and only 24% save for a specific purpose. However, trust in price comparison sites is high (55%), indicating engagement and self-management in financial matters. The closest direct evidence is the low rate of planning to use other investments for retirement, but this does not directly contradict the self-reliance attitude—it may reflect confidence in existing plans. Thus, I use the category baseline (60% agreement), slightly weighted down by the evidence of relatively low proactive retirement planning, but not enough to shift the category. Distribution: SA 27%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 7%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and moderate evidence alignment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=27.00%, Slightly agree=33.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a statement about personal responsibility and competence, which is generally socially desirable and especially salient among upmarket families. The most relevant quantitative evidence is from related attitudes: 'I trust financial price comparison sites' (0.55 agree), 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' (0.34 agree), and 'I only save for a specific purpose' (0.24 agree). None directly address retirement responsibility, but the low agreement with 'plans to use other investments for retirement' (0.16) suggests that while few plan alternative investments, this does not contradict a belief in personal responsibility. Given the upmarket segment (likely to endorse self-reliance slightly more), I nudge the baseline up a couple points. The final estimate is slightly above the category baseline, with a distribution reflecting moderate polarization (some will disagree, but most will agree).
Run 5: Strongly agree=27.00%, Slightly agree=33.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category. This category typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A) due to social desirability and positive self-concept, especially among upmarket families who are more likely to endorse personal responsibility. The closest quantitative evidence is moderate: only 16% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting some reliance on other means), but this is a behavior, not an attitude. Attitudinal evidence ('I only save for a specific purpose' at 24%) is lower, but not directly about responsibility. The most relevant evidence is the category baseline, with a slight upward calibration for this affluent segment (+3pp for high income). Therefore, the estimate is: SA 27%, A 33%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and moderate supporting evidence.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' baseline, which is appropriate given the lack of direct evidence for higher switching motivation among upmarket families. The quantitative evidence (high utility outgoings) is acknowledged but not over-interpreted, and the qualitative context supports the conclusion that effort barriers remain significant. No contradictory evidence is present, and the confidence in the estimate is well-supported by the evidence and reasoning provided.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' falls under the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, although switching suppliers can save money, it requires time, research, and administrative effort—barriers that deter many people. The provided quantitative evidence (high spending on utilities, but no direct evidence of high switching rates or enthusiasm for switching) does not indicate that this segment is unusually proactive about switching. Upmarket families may have the resources to switch, but also may value convenience and stability, further dampening agreement. Therefore, the baseline for effort-required behaviors (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is appropriate. No strong demographic calibration is warranted here, as the evidence does not suggest a major deviation from the general pattern. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' falls under the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, while switching suppliers can save money, it requires time, research, and administrative effort—barriers that deter many people. The quantitative evidence provided (high outgoings on utilities, but no direct evidence of switching behavior or high engagement with such activities) does not suggest unusually high motivation to overcome these barriers. Upmarket families may have more resources, but also value their time, and the effort involved in switching is a known friction point. Therefore, the baseline for this category (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is applied with high confidence, as no evidence suggests a significant deviation for this segment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, while switching suppliers can save money, it requires time, research, and administrative effort—barriers that deter many, even among cost-conscious or affluent groups. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting potential savings), but there is no direct evidence that this segment is more likely to switch or value the effort involved. Upmarket families may have more resources and could be slightly more proactive, but the effort barrier remains significant. Therefore, the baseline (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is used with no major demographic adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of evidence for higher agreement.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, despite potential cost savings, the perceived hassle and time investment deter many people. The quantitative evidence provided (high outgoings on utilities) suggests that this segment does spend significantly on these services, which could slightly increase agreement, but not enough to override the general effort aversion pattern. No direct evidence indicates unusually high willingness to switch or value the effort. Therefore, the baseline for effort-required behaviors (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of evidence to shift the baseline substantially.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' falls under the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, despite potential cost savings, the perceived hassle and time investment deter many people. The quantitative evidence shows that upmarket families have significant outgoings on utilities (value=5763.62), which could slightly increase motivation to switch, but the actual behavioral data (e.g., only 22% attend sporting events, 12% places of worship) suggests moderate engagement in non-essential activities, implying inertia is common. No direct evidence suggests higher-than-baseline switching activity. Therefore, the baseline (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is maintained, with a slight upward nudge for high utility spend, but not enough to move it out of the low-agreement category.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the quantitative toplines, which show moderate to high online purchase rates for 'Upmarket Families'—especially for higher-value items—indicating a lower reliance on cash. The adjustment from the baseline for 'Cash/Payment Preferences' is well explained, with agreement rates slightly reduced and disagreement increased to reflect the segment's digital orientation. The qualitative profile is used appropriately to support the calibration. The evidence selection is balanced, and the reasoning is transparent and methodologically sound. No major revisions are needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 11.20%
  Slightly agree: 22.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 23.80%
  Strongly disagree: 14.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~37% (SA 13%, A 24%). The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 26%, pet care 18%), but higher for home appliances (53%) and holiday/travel (63%). This suggests that for routine, lower-value purchases, cash and in-person payment methods are still common among 'Upmarket Families', but for higher-value or less frequent purchases, online (and thus non-cash) methods dominate. Upmarket Families may be less cash-dependent than older or rural segments, but not as digital-first as younger urban groups. Therefore, I slightly reduce the baseline agreement (from 37% to 32%) and increase disagreement, reflecting a moderate but not high preference for cash. The distribution maintains variance and aligns with the evidence that cash is not the dominant preference in this segment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The statement 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the payment preference category, which typically sees moderate agreement (baseline: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13%). For 'Upmarket Families', the quantitative evidence shows relatively high online purchase rates for home appliances (53%) and holiday/travel (63%), and even for alcohol (26%) and pet care (18%), suggesting a strong digital orientation and lower reliance on cash. This justifies a slight downward adjustment from the baseline for agreement, and a slight upward adjustment for disagreement. The qualitative profile of 'Upmarket Families' (affluent, tech-savvy, likely urban/suburban) further supports this. Therefore, agreement is slightly below the baseline, and disagreement is slightly above. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~37% agreement (SA 13%, A 24%). The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 26%, pet care 18%), but higher for home appliances (53%) and holidays (63%). This suggests that for routine, lower-value purchases, cash (or in-person payment) is still common among 'Upmarket Families', but for larger or less frequent purchases, online (and thus non-cash) is preferred. No evidence suggests a dramatic deviation from the baseline for this demographic. Upmarket Families may be slightly less cash-oriented than older/rural groups, but not dramatically so. Therefore, the baseline distribution is appropriate, with no major demographic calibration needed. Confidence is high due to strong relevance of the online purchase rates as a proxy for non-cash preference.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of 37% agreement (SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13%). The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 26%, pet care 18%), but higher for home appliances (53%) and holidays/travel (63%). This suggests that while Upmarket Families are comfortable with online (non-cash) payments for big-ticket or infrequent purchases, they are less likely to do so for routine purchases, implying a moderate but not high preference for cash. Demographically, Upmarket Families are likely to skew younger and more affluent, which would slightly reduce cash preference, but not dramatically. Therefore, the baseline is appropriate, with no major adjustments. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~37%. The quantitative evidence shows relatively high online purchase rates for home appliances (53%) and holiday/travel (63%), and lower but notable rates for alcohol (26%) and pet care (18%) among upmarket families. This suggests a moderate to low preference for cash, as this segment is comfortable with online (non-cash) transactions, especially for higher-value items. Upmarket families are typically more digitally engaged and less reliant on cash, so the baseline is adjusted downward. The final estimate reflects a slightly lower agreement than the generic baseline, with a higher proportion of disagreement, but still maintains some agreement due to age and situational variability within the segment.
