### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.66
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale correctly identifies that the available quantitative evidence (relating to behaviors such as managing or arranging accounts by phone, and country of birth) is not directly relevant to the target attitude concept. The use of a conservative baseline for attitudes is appropriate in the absence of direct or strong proxy evidence. The repeated application of the baseline template across runs, with moderate confidence due to lack of direct evidence, is methodologically sound. No unwarranted demographic or concept-specific calibration has been applied, and the evidence hierarchy has been respected. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the conservative baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about the target concept, only about unrelated behaviors (e.g., managing accounts by phone) and country of birth, all with very low values (1-12%). These do not directly inform the attitude concept, so the baseline is most appropriate. No demographic calibration is warranted, as the evidence is not concept-relevant. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the conservative baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about agreement with the target concept, and the only quantitative data provided relates to behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging accounts by phone) with very low prevalence (1-12%). However, these are not directly relevant to the attitude concept, so they do not justify a major adjustment. No qualitative evidence is provided that would shift the baseline. Therefore, the baseline attitude template is used without further adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative attitude baseline is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about the target concept, and the only retrieved quantitative data relates to behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging accounts by phone) with very low agreement (1-12%), but these are not directly relevant to the attitude concept. No qualitative evidence is provided that would justify deviation from the baseline. Following the evidence hierarchy, the absence of direct or strong proxy data means the baseline is most appropriate. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the conservative baseline template is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence for the target concept, and the only quantitative data provided relates to behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging accounts by phone) with very low agreement (1-12%). However, since these are not direct matches and the item is an attitude, the baseline is retained without further downward adjustment. No demographic calibration is applied due to lack of relevant context. Confidence is moderate due to the absence of direct evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative baseline template is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence indicating higher or lower agreement, and the only retrieved quantitative data relates to unrelated behaviors (e.g., managing accounts by phone, country of birth), all with very low values (1-12%). These do not suggest a need to adjust the baseline. No qualitative evidence is present to shift the prediction. Therefore, the default attitude template is applied without demographic or concept-specific calibration. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence for the specific concept.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.89
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the evidence hierarchy, giving strong weight to the direct quantitative data (only 9% self-identify as environmentalists, and only 24% agree that energy companies do not care about the environment). The baseline attitude template is appropriately overridden, with agreement categories sharply reduced and disagreement increased, reflecting the segment's low environmental concern. The run-level detail shows careful, incremental adjustment and high confidence is warranted due to the strength and relevance of the quantitative evidence. No unsupported assumptions or over-weighting of qualitative or demographic context is present. The justification is methodologically sound and well-grounded in the provided evidence.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 5.20%
  Slightly agree: 13.40%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.40%
  Slightly disagree: 28.80%
  Strongly disagree: 22.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=24.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events, for the 'upmarket families' segment. The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low agreement with 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (9%) and low agreement with 'energy companies do not care about the environment' (24%). There is no evidence of strong environmental concern in this segment. According to the evidence hierarchy, direct quantitative data (9% agreement with environmentalist identity) should dominate, so the baseline attitude template (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%) must be adjusted sharply downward. Given the 9% agreement on environmentalist identity, I predict even lower strong agreement (5%) and slightly agree (13%), with a majority neutral or disagreeing. No demographic calibration is warranted, as upmarket families do not show higher environmental concern. Variance is increased to reflect the low agreement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events. The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low agreement with environmentalist identity (9%) and low agreement that energy companies don't care about the environment (24%) among upmarket families. This indicates a low baseline of environmental concern in this segment. No direct data exists for the exact question, but the closest proxy ('I consider myself an environmentalist') is only 9%, which is much lower than even the conservative attitude baseline. Following the evidence hierarchy, I weight this quantitative data at 80%, and override the default attitude template (which would be SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%) by shifting agreement much lower and increasing disagreement. The result is a distribution with only 18% agreement (SA+A), 32% neutral, and 50% disagreement (D+SD), reflecting the segment's low environmental engagement. Confidence is high due to the strong, direct quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=14.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events. The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low agreement with environmentalist identity (9%) and low agreement that energy companies don't care about the environment (24%) among upmarket families. There is no direct evidence for the event-specific sustainability attitude, but the very low environmentalist self-identification (0.09) is a strong anchor, and the system guardrails require heavy weighting of this quantitative data. The baseline for attitude items is already conservative (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%), but given the direct evidence, agreement must be pushed even lower, with higher disagreement and neutrality. No demographic calibration is warranted, as upmarket families do not show higher environmental concern. Variance is increased to reflect the strong evidence of low agreement. Confidence is high due to the direct quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=14.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events. The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low agreement with environmentalist identity (9%) and low agreement that energy companies don't care about the environment (24%) among upmarket families. This suggests low salience of environmentalism in this segment. There is no direct data on event-specific sustainability attitudes, but the very low environmentalist self-identification (0.09) is a strong anchor. According to the evidence hierarchy, this direct quantitative data (weight 80%) should dominate. The baseline for attitude items is: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, given the much lower direct evidence, both agree categories should be reduced substantially, and disagree categories increased. The prediction is pushed further from the mean to reflect the low agreement, increasing variance as per instructions. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: 1. Concept type: This is an attitude question, so the conservative baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. 2. Quantitative evidence: Only 9% of this segment consider themselves environmentalists (very low), and just 24% think energy companies do not care about the environment (low skepticism). This suggests weak environmental concern. 3. Demographic calibration: Upmarket families might be slightly more attuned to sustainability, but the direct quantitative evidence is much stronger and overrides this. 4. Evidence hierarchy: The 9% environmentalist figure is highly relevant and authoritative, so agreement must be predicted much lower than the baseline. 5. Increased variance: Given the very low direct evidence, push agreement even lower and disagreement higher. Final estimate: Strongly agree 4%, Slightly agree 13%, Neither 28%, Slightly disagree 30%, Strongly disagree 25%. Confidence is high due to strong direct quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.81
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence and the methodological guidance. The rationale consistently applies the concept-specific correction for this item, which is supported by prior evidence of systematic under-prediction. While the direct attitudinal evidence from this segment (e.g., support for local businesses, digital attitudes) suggests generally low agreement with attitudinal statements, the high outgoings on housing/utilities provide a plausible motivation for efforts to economize. The lack of direct qualitative evidence is acknowledged, and the decision to prioritize the concept-specific correction is methodologically sound per the V2 prompt. No further demographic calibration is warranted, and the confidence level is appropriately high given the strength of the correction and absence of conflicting evidence. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 8.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a high-friction behavior but with a known under-prediction bias (+21pp correction required). The segment is 'upmarket families', who have high outgoings on housing and utilities (93.18), suggesting both high usage and potential cost-consciousness. There is no direct quantitative evidence for this exact item, but the concept-specific correction (SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%) is applied as per the V2 prompt. Demographic calibration is not applied further because upmarket families are not specifically flagged for additional lift on this concept. The qualitative evidence is weak, so the prediction relies primarily on the concept-specific correction. Confidence is high due to the strong concept-specific correction and lack of conflicting evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: 1) Concept type: This is an attitude item, but per the V2 prompt, it is one of the few concepts where the baseline is INCREASED due to prior under-prediction (-21pp). The template for this concept is: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%.

2) Quantitative evidence: There is no direct quantitative topline for this exact item, but the closest relevant data is the high outgoings on housing/utilities (93.18), which suggests this segment is highly exposed to energy costs. However, the general attitude items (supporting local businesses, liking chatbots, digital confusion) all show low agreement (16%, 27%, 12%), indicating this segment is not highly likely to strongly agree with attitudinal statements in general. However, the concept-specific correction for this item is to INCREASE agreement, as cost-consciousness is stronger than previously predicted.

3) Demographic calibration: This is an 'upmarket families' segment, which may have higher energy usage but also more means to act on cost-saving behaviors. However, per V2, demographic lifts are now more conservative (+4pp for family concepts, but this is already baked into the concept-specific correction).

4) Evidence hierarchy: No direct quantitative match, but the concept-specific correction dominates. No qualitative evidence is available for this specific item.

5) Variance: The distribution is intentionally more spread, matching the increased variance directive.

Final: Used the concept-specific correction template for this item, as instructed by the V2 prompt.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The item is an attitude statement ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the segment's high outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels (93.18), which suggests this is a salient expense and may motivate efforts to reduce usage. However, the only directly related attitude item ('I make an effort to support local businesses') has low agreement (16%), and digital/financial attitudes also show low engagement with new tech (chatbots: 27%, computers confuse me: 12%). The concept-specific correction for this item is to INCREASE by 21pp from the attitude baseline, as previous predictions under-predicted agreement. Therefore, I use the corrected template: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. No further demographic calibration is applied, as the high outgoings already suggest motivation to economize. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative relevance but lack of direct attitudinal evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-friction behavior but, per V2 guidance, is a known exception where actual agreement is higher than baseline. The segment is 'upmarket families', who have high outgoings on housing/utilities (93.18), but there is no direct evidence of strong cost-consciousness or environmentalism. Quantitative evidence for similar attitude items (supporting local businesses: 16%, chat bots: 27%, digital confusion: 12%) all show low agreement, suggesting this segment is not especially proactive or engaged in these domains. However, the concept-specific correction for this item is to increase agreement by 21pp over baseline, due to systematic under-prediction. Therefore, I apply the template: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. No further demographic lift is warranted, as upmarket families are not especially cost-driven. Confidence is high due to strong concept-specific correction and lack of contradictory quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: 1. Concept type: This is an 'attitude' item, but with a known correction (see V2 prompt) due to prior under-prediction (-21pp). The template for this concept is: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%.
2. Quantitative evidence: No direct quantitative topline for this exact item, but the segment spends heavily on housing/utilities (93.18), suggesting high relevance. However, their agreement with other 'effort' or 'pro-environment' attitudes is low (e.g., only 16% agree with 'I make an effort to support local businesses'), which would normally suggest lower agreement. However, the concept-specific correction (from V2) is authoritative and outweighs this, as it is based on systematic under-prediction for this item.
3. Demographic calibration: 'Upmarket families' might be expected to care about bills, but also may be less price-sensitive. However, the concept-specific correction is prioritized.
4. Variance: The prediction is pushed higher (25% SA, 35% A) per the V2 correction, matching the known under-prediction for this item.
5. Confidence: High, as the concept-specific correction is based on direct evidence from previous rounds.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.88
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is well justified and methodologically sound. The rationale consistently recognizes that the closest quantitative anchor (49% for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' as important) is broader and less restrictive than the target concept ('fuel consumption is the most important feature'). The adjustment to lower agreement rates for the stricter statement is appropriate, and the use of a conservative baseline is justified by both the evidence and the segment profile. The repeated nudges (+1pp for SA/A) are minor and well explained, reflecting the slightly higher anchor without over-interpreting it. The lack of qualitative override is correctly noted. Overall, the evidence selection and calibration logic are transparent and robust. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 5.80%
  Slightly agree: 15.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 28.60%
  Strongly disagree: 21.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=16.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item, but the evidence shows only moderate agreement with related environmental priorities (49% say environmentally friendly/low CO2 is important when buying a car). However, the target concept is more restrictive ('most important feature'), which is likely to have lower agreement. The closest quantitative anchor (0.49) is for 'important', not 'most important', so agreement should be lower. The conservative baseline for this concept (per system prompt) is SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. No evidence suggests higher agreement for this upmarket family segment, and the segment's insurance and environmental attitudes are also low (13% and 24% respectively). Therefore, I use the concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important' (SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%) and nudge slightly higher (SA +1pp, A +1pp) due to the 49% anchor for 'important', but not much higher since 'most important' is a stricter criterion. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=16.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=29.00%, Strongly disagree=21.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item, but the specific statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is more exclusive than simply considering fuel economy as important. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 49%, but this is a broader and more positive framing than 'fuel consumption is the most important feature.' The concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' is to reduce by 30pp, using the template: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. Given the upmarket families segment (likely to value quality, safety, and brand as well), I slightly increase 'slightly agree' by 1pp and decrease 'strongly disagree' by 1pp, but keep the overall distribution close to the corrected template. Quantitative evidence is strong and directly relevant, so confidence is high.
Run 3: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=16.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item, but the evidence shows that only 49% of upmarket families rate 'environmentally friendly/low CO2' as important when buying a car (quantitative, relevance 0.98). This is the closest direct proxy for 'fuel consumption is the most important feature', and likely overstates agreement since 'most important' is a higher bar than 'important'. Other evidence (insurance, energy attitudes) is much lower (13%, 24%), suggesting this segment is not highly motivated by cost/environment in car choice. The concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important' is to reduce by 30pp from the attitude baseline, yielding a distribution of SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. Given the direct evidence is slightly higher than the correction template, I nudge agreement up by 1pp each for SA/A. No qualitative evidence is available to override this. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxy.
Run 4: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=16.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the evidence shows only moderate agreement with related environmental priorities (49% say environmentally friendly/low CO2 is important when buying a car). This is a broader, less demanding criterion than 'most important feature,' so actual agreement with the stricter statement will be lower. The segment (upmarket families) may care about environmental issues somewhat, but the low agreement with 'energy companies do not care about the environment' (24%) and 'well insured for everything' (13%) suggests a pragmatic, not idealistic, orientation. The concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' is to REDUCE by 30pp, with a template of SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. Given the direct evidence (49% for a broader, less strict item), I nudge agreement up slightly (SA 6%, A 16%), but keep the overall distribution close to the corrected template. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item, but the specific statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is more exclusive than simply rating fuel consumption as important. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 49%, but this is a broader and more positively framed item than the target, which asks about fuel consumption as the single most important feature. The conservative baseline for this concept (per prompt) is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. No evidence suggests this segment (upmarket families) would rate fuel consumption as more important than the general population; if anything, their higher income may make them less price-sensitive to fuel costs, so no upward demographic calibration is warranted. The other evidence (insurance, environmental attitudes) is much lower, supporting a conservative estimate. Variance is maintained as per instructions. Confidence is high due to the strong relevance of the 49% quantitative anchor, but the stricter wording of the target concept justifies a lower prediction.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently notes the lack of direct quantitative evidence on debt aversion for upmarket families, but appropriately uses the closest proxies (risk tolerance, community engagement, climate concern) to infer that this segment is not especially debt-averse. The application of a concept-specific correction (to address systematic over-prediction) is methodologically sound, and the decision not to apply a demographic lift is well-supported by the evidence and segment profile. The confidence is high due to the clear, consistent application of the correction and the absence of contradictory data. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The most relevant quantitative evidence is from the same segment (upmarket families), but none of the provided toplines directly measure debt aversion. The closest proxies are low agreement rates for risk-taking with money (32%) and helping in the community (13%), both suggesting a cautious, but not extremely risk-averse, profile. The concept-specific correction for this item (based on systematic over-prediction in V1) is to use: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. No evidence suggests this segment is more debt-averse than the general population, so no demographic lift is applied. The prediction is therefore anchored to the corrected template. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong concept-specific calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The V2 template for this concept (based on systematic over-prediction in V1) is: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence from this upmarket families segment shows relatively low agreement with other 'cautious' or 'community-oriented' attitudes (e.g., only 13% help out in the community, 28% see climate change as a major threat, 32% are risk-tolerant with money). There is no direct evidence on debt aversion, but the moderate risk tolerance and low community engagement suggest this group is not especially debt-averse compared to the general population. No demographic calibration is applied, as upmarket families are not strongly associated with higher or lower debt aversion. The concept-specific correction is therefore applied directly, with no further adjustment. Confidence is high due to the strong weighting of the concept-specific correction and the lack of contradictory quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The segment is 'upmarket families' (higher income, family-oriented). Direct quantitative evidence is not available for debt aversion, but related attitudes show low agreement rates: only 13% help out in the community, 28% see climate change as a major threat, 26% likely to move, and 32% are risk-tolerant with money. These all indicate a generally moderate-to-low tendency to strongly agree with attitudinal statements in this segment. The concept-specific correction for 'don't like being in debt' is to use: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (reflecting a -26pp correction from previous over-prediction). No strong demographic lift is applied, as upmarket families may be more comfortable with debt (e.g., mortgages, investments), so no upward adjustment. The distribution is therefore set exactly to the concept-specific correction template. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and clear template guidance.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The segment is 'ACORN upmarket families'. There is no direct quantitative evidence for debt aversion, but the closest proxies (risk-taking with money = 0.32, helping in community = 0.13, climate threat concern = 0.28) all show relatively low agreement rates, suggesting this segment is less likely to strongly agree with negative financial attitudes than the general population. The concept-specific correction for this item is to use: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (per prompt, due to +26pp over-prediction bias in v1). No demographic lift is applied, as upmarket families are not especially debt-averse compared to the general population, and the evidence suggests moderate to low agreement with attitudinal statements. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and a clear concept-specific correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The most relevant quantitative evidence is from the same segment (upmarket families), but none of the provided toplines directly address debt aversion. The closest proxies are: 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (32% agree), which suggests a moderate risk tolerance, and 'Helping out in the community' (13% agree), which is low and indicates a less collectivist orientation. The climate change concern is also low (28%), suggesting this group is not highly driven by strong pro-social or risk-averse attitudes. The concept-specific correction for this item is to use: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (per system prompt), which is lower than the previous over-predicted baseline. No evidence suggests this segment is more debt-averse than average, so no demographic lift is applied. Confidence is high due to the clear system correction and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.72
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently acknowledges the lack of direct quantitative data on self-perceived money management skill for Upmarket Families, and appropriately uses relevant proxies (moderate online savings management, high car ownership, high outgoings) to inform only a modest uplift from the attitude baseline. The calibration is conservative and avoids over-claiming, with clear reasoning for not applying the full +5pp uplift. Variance is maintained, and confidence scores are appropriately moderate. No major evidence is overlooked, and the approach is methodologically sound given the constraints.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.40%
  Slightly agree: 28.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 31.20%
  Slightly disagree: 17.00%
  Strongly disagree: 10.40%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=14.00%, Slightly agree=29.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=11.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an attitude item. For ACORN Upmarket Families, there is no direct quantitative evidence about self-perceived money management skill, but some relevant proxies: high outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services (suggesting financial comfort, not necessarily skill), low worry about car theft (suggesting low financial anxiety), and moderate online savings management (35%). The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Upmarket Families may have slightly higher confidence in money management, but not dramatically so, as high income does not always correlate with high self-rated skill. Therefore, I lift agreement by a modest +3pp (less than the full +5pp for high income, per v2 calibration). No evidence suggests strong polarization or extreme agreement. The final distribution is slightly above baseline for agreement, with a confidence score of 0.72 due to moderate proxy evidence but no direct quantitative data.
Run 2: Strongly agree=14.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=16.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: This is an attitude item for 'Upmarket Families'. Quantitative evidence is limited: only 35% manage savings online (suggests moderate financial engagement), but 90% own their main car (implies financial stability). No direct data on self-perceived money management skill. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Upmarket Families may have slightly higher confidence in money management, so I lift SA/A by +2pp each, reduce D/SD by -2pp each, and leave N similar. No evidence of extreme agreement or disagreement, so I avoid pushing to extremes. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=11.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I am very good at managing money'), so the attitude baseline is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. For 'Upmarket Families', there is no direct quantitative evidence about self-perceived money management skill, but some relevant proxies: 35% manage savings online (moderate digital engagement), and high spending on miscellaneous goods/services (suggests comfort with discretionary spending, not necessarily frugality or skill). There is no evidence of financial stress or worry (very low car theft worry, high car ownership), but these do not directly indicate money management confidence. No evidence suggests strong over- or under-confidence. Demographic calibration for 'Upmarket Families' (higher income, more financial products) would normally lift agreement slightly, but per v2 instructions, this is now only +5pp and only if evidence supports it. Here, the evidence is neutral, so only a slight +2pp is applied to agreement. Variance is increased slightly to avoid clustering. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I am very good at managing money'), so the attitude baseline is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. For 'Upmarket Families', there is a mild positive calibration for financial self-efficacy, but the evidence is mixed: only 35% manage savings online (suggesting not all are highly proactive), and there is no direct evidence of strong financial confidence. No direct quantitative data on self-assessed money management skill is provided, so the baseline is only slightly lifted (+3pp to SA/A combined) to reflect the segment's likely above-average confidence, but not dramatically so. Variance is maintained by keeping a substantial 'Neither' and 'Disagree' share. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I am very good at managing money'), so the attitude baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. For 'Upmarket Families', there is a slight positive calibration for financial confidence, but per v2, this is only +5pp to agreement. Quantitative evidence is limited: 35% manage savings online (moderate digital engagement), but this is not a direct proxy for self-assessed money management skill. High outgoings on miscellaneous goods (85.2) and high private car ownership (89.5%) suggest affluence, but not necessarily prudent money management. The very low worry about car theft (2%) is not directly relevant. No direct quantitative evidence on self-assessed money management, so the attitude baseline is only slightly lifted. To increase variance and avoid over-prediction, I keep agreement moderate: SA 13%, A 28%, N 32%, D 17%, SD 10%. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies a concept-specific correction for systematic over-prediction, which is appropriate given the history of bias for this concept. The most relevant quantitative evidence—low agreement (12%) with a similar 'practical' attitude (fuel consumption as most important feature when buying a car)—is highly relevant and strongly supports a low agreement prediction for the insurance concept. The absence of qualitative or demographic evidence contradicting this approach is correctly noted, and the decision not to apply demographic upweighting is justified. The repeated use of the high friction behavior template, with explicit reference to the correction, demonstrates methodological rigor. Confidence is high due to the directness and strength of the evidence and the explicit correction for known bias.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is subject to a specific corrective adjustment due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp bias in prior rounds). The correct template is the HIGH FRICTION BEHAVIOR correction: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. Quantitative evidence for this upmarket family segment shows low agreement with other 'responsibility' or 'practicality' attitudes (e.g., only 12% say fuel consumption is most important when buying a car), supporting a low agreement prediction. No direct evidence suggests this segment is unusually insurance-focused. Demographic calibration is not applied, as the concept-specific correction dominates. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and the explicit concept-specific correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything', which is a high-friction behavior/attitude (requires action, cost, and planning). The most relevant quantitative evidence is for a similar high-friction, practical attitude: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.12, i.e., 12% agreement), which is very low and highly relevant (relevance=0.98). This suggests that for this upmarket family segment, practical, cost-conscious, or risk-averse attitudes are not dominant. The concept-specific correction for 'well insured for everything' is to use a much lower baseline (SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%), reflecting systematic over-prediction in previous versions. No qualitative evidence is available to contradict this. Demographic calibration (upmarket families) would normally slightly increase agreement, but the direct quantitative evidence is so low that it overrides any demographic lift. Confidence is high due to the strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is subject to a specific corrective template due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp bias in v1). The most relevant quantitative evidence is for a similar 'practical' attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), which is very low (12% agreement) among upmarket families. This supports a low agreement prediction for insurance as well, since both reflect practical, cost-conscious priorities. The concept-specific correction for 'well insured for everything' is to use: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. No demographic upweighting is justified (upmarket families are not especially insurance-focused in the absence of direct evidence). No qualitative override is available. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and a direct concept-specific correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is subject to a specific corrective template due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp bias in v1). The most relevant quantitative evidence is for a similar 'practical/financial' attitude (fuel consumption as most important feature when buying a car), which is very low (12%). This suggests a low prioritization of practical/financial caution in this segment. No qualitative evidence is available to contradict this. According to the V2 prompt, the high friction behavior template (not attitude) is used, with the concept-specific correction: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. No demographic lift is applied, as upmarket families do not show a strong insurance focus in the evidence. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and strong concept-specific correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is subject to a specific corrective adjustment due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp in prior rounds). The most relevant quantitative evidence is for a similar 'practical' attitude (fuel consumption as most important feature when buying a car), which is very low (12%). This suggests a pragmatic, cost-conscious segment that does not prioritize comprehensive insurance. No direct evidence supports high agreement. The baseline for this concept is the high friction behavior template, further reduced per the concept-specific correction: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. No demographic upweighting is justified, as the segment (upmarket families) does not show strong insurance prioritization in the available data. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and a direct concept-specific correction.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes among upmarket families is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The topline quantitative data on actual eating habits (very low vegan/vegetarian rates, high meat consumption) is appropriately used to infer that strong behavioral commitment to restrictive healthy diets is rare. The rationale correctly notes that attitudes toward healthy eating are broader than dietary behavior, so agreement may be higher than actual practice. The use of a conservative attitude baseline, with minor adjustments in some runs to reflect possible modest health consciousness, is methodologically sound in the absence of direct attitudinal data. The confidence level is appropriately described as moderate-high or high, given the strong behavioral data but lack of direct attitude measurement. No major corrective feedback is needed; the approach is balanced and evidence-based.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.80%
  Slightly agree: 26.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.80%
  Slightly disagree: 18.40%
  Strongly disagree: 13.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). Direct quantitative evidence shows only 0.9% vegan, 5.5% vegetarian, and 19.5% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 73% eating meat. This suggests that while a minority actively pursue restrictive healthy diets, the majority do not. However, 'Healthy Eating' as an attitude is broader than dietary restriction and may attract more agreement than actual behavior. No direct quantitative data on 'Healthy Eating' attitude is provided, so the conservative attitude baseline is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. No demographic calibration is applied, as upmarket families do not show strong deviation in the evidence. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence on actual eating habits, but lack of direct attitude data.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude type). Direct quantitative evidence shows only 0.86% vegan, 5.5% vegetarian, and 19.5% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 73% eating meat. This suggests that while a minority practice restrictive healthy eating, the majority do not. However, 'Healthy Eating' as an attitude is broader than dietary restriction and may have higher agreement than actual behavior. No direct quantitative data on the attitude itself is provided, so the conservative attitude baseline is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. No demographic or concept-specific corrections are warranted, as upmarket families do not show strong deviation in the evidence. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong behavioral data but lack of direct attitudinal measurement.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=16.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude type). Direct quantitative evidence shows only 0.86% vegan, 5.5% vegetarian, and 19.5% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with a dominant 73% eating meat. This suggests that while a small minority practice restrictive diets, the majority do not, but this does not directly measure attitudes toward healthy eating—many meat-eaters may still value healthy eating. Therefore, the attitude baseline is used but shifted slightly downward to reflect the low prevalence of restrictive diets, indicating that strong agreement is likely modest. No qualitative evidence suggests unusually high or low health consciousness. The distribution is slightly more neutral and less positive than the default attitude template, with increased 'neither' and slightly reduced agreement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence on actual eating patterns, though not a direct attitude measure.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=16.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). Quantitative evidence shows only 0.9% vegan, 5.5% vegetarian, and 19.5% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 73% eating meat. This suggests that while a minority actively pursue non-meat diets, a significant portion may still value healthy eating in principle, but not to the extent of adopting restrictive diets. The attitude template baseline (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%) is used, but slightly increased agreement (+2pp to SA/A) to reflect that upmarket families may be more health-conscious than average, but not dramatically so given the high meat consumption. The 'neither' category is increased to 32% to reflect ambivalence between valuing healthy eating and actual dietary choices. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude type). Direct quantitative evidence shows only 0.9% vegan, 5.5% vegetarian, and 19.5% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 73% eating meat. This suggests that while a minority practice restrictive diets, the majority are not highly committed to healthy eating as defined by plant-based or alternative diets. However, 'healthy eating' as an attitude is broader than just diet type, so some agreement is likely, but not strong. Using the conservative attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%), and given the lack of strong evidence for high agreement, no upward adjustment is warranted. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.79
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run demonstrates careful consideration of the available quantitative evidence, particularly the low proportion planning to use other investments for retirement (16%) and low goal-oriented saving (24%). These are directly relevant proxies for the concept of personal responsibility for retirement security. The use of a baseline for attitude items is appropriate, and the adjustments (slight increases or decreases in agreement/disagreement) are well explained and proportional to the evidence. The absence of strong qualitative evidence is acknowledged, and demographic calibration is considered but not over-applied. The confidence level is appropriate given the strong relevance of the quantitative proxies. No major methodological gaps are present.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.80%
  Slightly agree: 27.40%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.80%
  Slightly disagree: 18.40%
  Strongly disagree: 12.60%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=29.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about personal responsibility for retirement security. For 'upmarket families', direct quantitative evidence on 'plans to use other investments for retirement' is low (16%), suggesting limited proactive behavior, but this does not directly measure agreement with the responsibility statement. Related attitudes ('I only save for a specific purpose' at 24%, 'switching utilities worth the effort' at 34%) also indicate moderate to low engagement with financial self-management. The baseline for attitude items is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the segment's moderate trust in financial comparison sites (55%), there may be slightly higher agreement with self-responsibility, but not dramatically so. No evidence suggests strong polarization or high agreement. Therefore, I slightly lift agreement by 2pp above baseline, resulting in: SA 13%, A 27%, N 29%, D 18%, SD 13%. Confidence is high due to multiple relevant quantitative items, but none are a direct match.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement, so the attitude baseline applies (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%). Quantitative evidence shows relatively low agreement with related financial self-reliance attitudes in this segment: only 16% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting low proactive self-reliance), and only 24% save for a specific purpose (low goal-oriented saving). These both indicate less strong agreement than the baseline. However, 55% trust price comparison sites (suggesting some financial engagement), and 34% think switching utilities is worth the effort (moderate, but not high, engagement). No direct evidence for the exact concept, but the pattern is moderate engagement and moderate self-reliance. Therefore, I slightly lower the baseline agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No strong demographic calibration is warranted for 'upmarket families' on this concept. Confidence is moderate-high due to multiple relevant quantitative proxies.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=29.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: This is an attitude item for 'upmarket families.' The most relevant quantitative evidence is low agreement with 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (16%) and moderate agreement with 'I only save for a specific purpose' (24%). These suggest a relatively low sense of proactive personal responsibility for retirement, despite the segment's affluence. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low direct agreement on related retirement responsibility and saving purpose, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Demographic calibration (affluent/family) would normally lift agreement slightly, but the quantitative evidence overrides this. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative relevance.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about personal responsibility for retirement security. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (16%), which is quite low, and 'I only save for a specific purpose' (24%), also low. These suggest that proactive, individual-focused retirement planning is not strongly embraced in this segment. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low quantitative agreement with related items, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No qualitative evidence suggests a stronger sense of personal responsibility. Demographic calibration (upmarket families) would normally nudge agreement up, but the direct evidence is weak, so I do not apply it. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is an attitude item. The most relevant quantitative evidence is from the same segment (upmarket families): only 16% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting low proactive responsibility), and only 24% save for a specific purpose (indicating low goal-oriented saving). Agreement that 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is also low (34%), suggesting moderate inertia and limited proactive financial behavior. The baseline for attitude items is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low evidence for proactive retirement planning, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Demographic calibration is minimal, as upmarket families might be slightly more financially responsible, but the direct evidence is more influential. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative matches.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies a concept-specific template for high-friction behaviors, which is appropriate given the lack of direct switching data but strong contextual evidence (high utility outgoings, moderate engagement in non-routine activities). The repeated application of the template is well-supported by the evidence hierarchy, and the absence of qualitative or quantitative evidence to the contrary further supports the estimate. The confidence level is appropriately moderate-high, reflecting the indirect but relevant evidence base. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort', which is classified as a high friction behavior (requires effort, often avoided despite potential savings). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the lack of direct data on switching, but high outgoings on utilities (5763.62 per year) suggest awareness of costs, though not necessarily motivation to switch. The baseline for high friction behavior is SA 5%, A 18%, N 27%, D 28%, SD 22%. However, the concept-specific correction for this item is to REDUCE by 15pp due to systematic over-prediction (people rarely act even if they agree in principle). The upmarket families segment may be slightly more cost-conscious due to high bills, but this is offset by inertia typical in this segment. Therefore, I use the concept-specific template: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the absence of direct switching data.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: 1. Concept type: This is a high friction behavior (switching utilities), so the baseline is low agreement (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%).
2. Quantitative evidence: No direct data on switching, but upmarket families have high outgoings on utilities (suggesting potential savings), yet only 22% attend sporting events and 12% places of worship—indicating moderate engagement in non-routine activities. This supports the idea that inertia is likely strong, so agreement should not be lifted.
3. Demographic calibration: Upmarket families might be slightly more proactive, but the new calibration is conservative (+0-2pp at most), and the concept-specific correction already accounts for over-prediction bias.
4. No qualitative evidence directly contradicts the baseline. 
5. Confidence is high due to strong concept-specific template and lack of direct contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude about switching utilities, which is classified as a high-friction behavior (requires effort, paperwork, and is often avoided despite potential savings). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the lack of direct data on switching rates, but the segment (upmarket families) shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting potential for savings), yet only moderate engagement with community activities (e.g., 22% attend sporting events, 12% places of worship), indicating moderate but not high proactivity. The concept-specific correction for 'Switching utilities worth effort' is to reduce agreement by 15pp from the attitude baseline, resulting in: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. No direct quantitative evidence overrides this, and qualitative notes are neutral. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and segment context, but not direct switching data.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as a high friction behavior. The baseline for this type is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting awareness of costs), but there is no direct evidence of high switching rates or strong motivation to switch. The segment (upmarket families) may have more resources but also more inertia due to complexity or satisfaction with current providers. No qualitative evidence suggests unusually high or low motivation to switch. Therefore, the baseline template is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative relevance and clear concept type alignment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as a high friction behavior. The baseline for this type is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (per concept-specific correction). Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting awareness of costs), but there is no direct evidence of high switching rates or strong motivation to switch. The upmarket families segment may be somewhat more cost-conscious, but not enough to warrant a positive adjustment, especially given the system's prior over-prediction bias. No qualitative evidence suggests unusually high or low motivation to switch. Therefore, the concept-specific template is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative context but lack of direct switching data.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I like to use cash when making purchases' among ACORN Upmarket Families is well justified. The rationale consistently applies a concept-specific correction to the attitude baseline, reflecting higher digital adoption in this segment. Quantitative evidence on online purchase rates across several categories (alcoholic drinks, pet care, home appliances, holiday/travel) is used appropriately as a proxy for digital payment adoption, supporting the moderate digital engagement conclusion. The qualitative profile is referenced to avoid over-correcting for digital adoption. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the final distribution is consistent across runs, with high confidence and no major gaps in logic or evidence use. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 23.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases' for ACORN Upmarket Families. This is an attitude item, but the concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' applies: reduce by 12pp from the attitude baseline due to higher digital adoption. Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for alcohol (26%) and pet care (18%), but much higher for home appliances (53%) and holiday/travel (63%). This suggests moderate digital adoption, but not as high as the general population for all categories. Upmarket Families are likely to use cards and digital payments for larger purchases, but may still use cash for smaller, everyday items. The concept-specific template (SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%) fits well, as there is no strong evidence to push agreement much higher or lower. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative proxies and a clear concept-specific correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases' for ACORN Upmarket Families. This is an attitude item, so the attitude baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, the concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to reduce by 12pp due to over-prediction in previous rounds, so the template is SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for alcohol (26%) and pet care (18%), but much higher for home appliances (53%) and holiday/travel (63%). This suggests moderate digital adoption, but not extremely high. Upmarket Families are likely to be digitally engaged, but not as much as the most affluent/urban segments. No direct quantitative evidence on cash preference, so the concept-specific template is used with no further demographic lift. Confidence is high due to strong concept-specific correction and relevant proxy data.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases' for ACORN Upmarket Families. This is an attitude item, but the concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' applies: reduce by 12pp from the attitude baseline due to higher digital adoption. Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for alcohol (26%) and pet care (18%), but much higher for home appliances (53%) and holiday/travel (63%), suggesting this segment is digitally active for higher-value or planned purchases, but less so for everyday items. However, the overall trend for upmarket families is toward digital adoption, so cash preference is likely below the general population. Applying the concept-specific template (SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%) fits both the evidence and the required correction. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and a direct concept-specific correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: 1. Concept type: This is an attitude item, so the baseline template is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. 2. Quantitative evidence: For 'Upmarket Families', online purchase rates are moderate to high for most categories (e.g., 53% for home appliances, 63% for holidays), but much lower for alcohol (26%) and pet care (18%). This suggests a mixed but overall moderate digital adoption. 3. Concept-specific correction: For 'like to use cash', the V2 template is SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15% (already adjusted down by 12pp from V1 to account for higher digital adoption). 4. Demographic calibration: Upmarket Families are likely to be more digitally engaged, but the evidence is not as strong as for the youngest or most urban segments, so no further downward adjustment is made. 5. Evidence hierarchy: Quantitative data on online purchase behavior is the strongest evidence and supports the use of the corrected template. 6. Variance: The prediction is not regressed toward the mean, as the evidence supports a moderate spread. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and a well-matched concept-specific correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: 1) Concept type is 'attitude', so start from the revised attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%). 2) Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for alcohol (26%) and pet care (18%), but higher for home appliances (53%) and holiday/travel (63%). This suggests some digital adoption, but not universal. 3) The target group is 'Upmarket Families', who are likely to be moderately digitally engaged but not the most cash-averse. 4) Concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to reduce by 12pp from baseline, but the evidence here suggests a moderate digital adoption, so stick close to the corrected template. 5) No strong evidence to push agreement much higher or lower. 6) Final distribution: SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and clear demographic profile.
