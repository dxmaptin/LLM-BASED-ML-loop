### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.78
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The topline quantitative data (low prevalence of relevant behaviors, moderate relevance scores) supports the conclusion that agreement with the target attitude is likely low. The rationale for defaulting to a generic attitude baseline is sound, as the concept is only labeled as 'attitude' with no further detail, and the evidence does not suggest a more specific or higher-agreement category. The repeated runs consistently apply this logic, and the confidence level is appropriately moderate-high due to the indirect but directionally supportive evidence. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is labeled as 'attitude' but with no further detail, so the default is to classify it as a generic attitude unless evidence suggests otherwise. The quantitative evidence provided relates to behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging a current account by phone), but the agreement rates are extremely low (3% to 12%), indicating low engagement or agreement with those behaviors in this segment. However, since the target is an attitude (not a behavior), and there is no evidence of cost-consciousness, self-reliance, or other higher-agreement categories, the best fit is 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' or generic attitude, both of which have a baseline of about 30% agreement (SA+A). The evidence does not justify raising this baseline. Therefore, the estimate is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is moderate-high due to the clear lack of strong agreement in the behavioral evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.80 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' but with no further context, so the semantic category defaults to 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' or generic attitude, both of which have a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA+A). The quantitative evidence provided is about current account management by phone (values 0.12 and 0.03), and country of birth (values 0.02), all with moderate to high relevance, but these values are very low and suggest low engagement or agreement with the behaviors/attitudes measured. Since the evidence is not directly about the target concept but is the only quantitative data available, it is weighted at 50% and pulls the estimate slightly lower than the baseline. No demographic calibration is applied due to lack of specifics. The final estimate is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is moderate-high due to the alignment of both the semantic category and the direction of the quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.75 / Rationale: The concept is labeled as 'attitude' with no further detail, so the semantic category defaults to 'Generic Attitude' unless more context is provided. The quantitative evidence provided is about country of birth and managing/arranging current accounts by phone, but these have low relevance to a generic attitude concept (relevance scores 0.76-0.80, but the actual values are very low, indicating low prevalence for those behaviors). No evidence directly contradicts the baseline for a generic attitude, which is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 25% slightly disagree, and 15% strongly disagree (30% agreement). No demographic calibration is applied due to lack of specific demographic context. Confidence is moderate because the evidence is not directly relevant to the concept, but the semantic category is clear.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The item is labeled as an 'attitude' with no further specifics, so the default is to classify it as a generic attitude unless more context is provided. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account by phone' at 12%, 'Arrange current account by phone' at 3%) is low and only moderately relevant (relevance ~0.77-0.80), suggesting low agreement with related behaviors. No evidence points to a cost-consciousness, self-reliance, or other higher-agreement category. Thus, the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' or generic attitude baseline (30% agreement: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is most appropriate. No demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence. Confidence is moderate-high due to clear category fit and supporting low agreement evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.80 / Rationale: The item is labeled as 'attitude' with no further detail, so I default to the most conservative semantic category: Environmental Virtue Signaling (or generic attitude if not environmental), which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). The quantitative evidence provided is not directly relevant to the concept (it is about country of birth and managing accounts by phone), so it does not override the baseline. No demographic calibration is warranted due to lack of specific context. The distribution maintains variance and matches the category pattern. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong category fit and lack of conflicting evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references highly relevant quantitative evidence: extremely low self-identification as environmentalists (7%) and low agreement that energy companies do not care about the environment (29%), both of which are directly related to the target concept. The baseline for the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' category is clearly stated and the adjustments made (lowering agreement, increasing disagreement and neutrality) are logical and proportionate to the evidence. The qualitative context is acknowledged but not over-weighted, which is appropriate given the high relevance and strength of the quantitative data. The confidence is high and the reasoning is transparent and replicable. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 7.60%
  Slightly agree: 19.40%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 29.20%
  Slightly disagree: 25.80%
  Strongly disagree: 18.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=19.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA+A). The quantitative evidence for this segment shows very low agreement with environmentalist identity (7%) and low agreement with negative attitudes toward energy companies (29%), both below even the category baseline. This suggests this segment is less environmentally engaged than average. Therefore, I have adjusted the agreement downward from the baseline: Strongly agree 8%, Slightly agree 18%, with a higher proportion in neutral and disagreement. The evidence is highly relevant and directly overrides the generic category baseline. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=20.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). The quantitative evidence from this segment is even lower: only 7% consider themselves environmentalists and 29% agree that energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating weak pro-environmental attitudes. No evidence suggests higher agreement. Therefore, the estimate is slightly below the category baseline, with a combined 27% agreement (7% SA, 20% A), 30% neutral, and 43% disagreement (25% SD, 18% D). Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=19.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events') is an environmental attitude, which fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category. The baseline for this category is low agreement (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows extremely low agreement with related environmental attitudes: only 7% consider themselves environmentalists, and 29% think energy companies do not care about the environment. This suggests even lower agreement than the already-low baseline. Given this, I have shifted slightly more weight to disagreement (D and SD) and slightly reduced 'slightly agree' to 18%. The segment is likely to be older and less progressive (constrained pensioners), which further reduces agreement with environmental virtue signaling. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=21.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events') is an environmental attitude, not a behavior, so it fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category (baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows very low agreement with environmentalist identity (7%) and low agreement that energy companies do not care about the environment (29%), both below even the already-low category baseline. This suggests even less environmental concern than the general population. Therefore, I slightly reduce the 'agree' shares and increase 'disagree' shares relative to the baseline. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=20.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA+A). The quantitative evidence from this segment shows very low agreement with environmentalist identity (7%) and low agreement that energy companies don't care about the environment (29%), both of which are directly relevant and suggest even lower environmental concern than the general population. Therefore, the baseline is adjusted downward: Strongly agree is kept low (8%), slightly agree is reduced (20%), and disagreement is increased (25% slightly, 17% strongly). The neither group is kept high (30%) to reflect ambivalence. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently and appropriately grounds the high agreement rates in the strong quantitative evidence that 'constrained pensioners' spend a very high proportion of their outgoings (76.7%) on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels. This directly supports the expectation that this group is highly motivated to cut down on these costs. The absence of contradictory digital or attitudinal evidence is correctly noted, and demographic calibration is sensibly applied. The repeated use of a high baseline for cost-consciousness behaviors is methodologically sound given the evidence. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 31.20%
  Slightly agree: 39.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 14.80%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is a classic example of a 'Cost-Consciousness Behavior'—actions that save money with minimal effort. This category has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because nearly everyone, especially financially constrained groups, is motivated to reduce utility bills. The quantitative evidence shows that this segment ('constrained pensioners') spends a very high proportion of their outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels (76.7%), which further increases the likelihood that they are highly motivated to cut down on these costs. There is no evidence of digital or environmental attitudes overriding this cost-saving motivation. Demographically, this group is likely older and lower income, which aligns with even higher cost-consciousness. Therefore, the baseline (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%) is appropriate, with high confidence due to strong quantitative support.
Run 2: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=38.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is a classic example of a 'Cost-Consciousness Behavior' (Category 1). This category typically sees high agreement (~70%) because saving money on unavoidable bills is a universal priority, especially for financially constrained groups. The quantitative evidence shows that this segment spends a very high proportion (76.7%) of their outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels, which strongly reinforces the likelihood that they are highly motivated to reduce these costs. There is no evidence of digital or attitudinal factors that would reduce this motivation. Demographic calibration for a constrained/low-income segment would slightly increase agreement (+2pp), but the baseline is already high. Therefore, the estimate is: Strongly agree 32%, Slightly agree 38%, Neither 15%, Slightly disagree 10%, Strongly disagree 5%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=38.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is a classic example of a 'Cost-Consciousness Behavior' (Category 1). This category is characterized by high agreement (baseline ~70%) because saving money on unavoidable expenses like utilities is a universal priority, especially for financially constrained groups. The quantitative evidence shows that this segment spends a very high proportion (76.7%) of their outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels, which strongly incentivizes efforts to reduce these costs. There is no evidence of digital or attitudinal resistance to cost-saving behaviors. Demographic calibration (constrained pensioners) would, if anything, slightly increase agreement due to fixed incomes and high sensitivity to utility costs. Therefore, the estimate is slightly above the category baseline, with high confidence due to strong direct quantitative support.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving money on unavoidable bills is a universal priority, especially for financially constrained groups. The quantitative evidence shows that this segment spends a very high proportion of their outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels (76.7%), which strongly reinforces the likelihood that they are motivated to reduce these costs. There is no evidence of digital or environmental attitudes overriding this cost-saving motivation. Demographic calibration for this segment (likely lower income, older, and financially constrained) would slightly increase agreement, but the baseline is already high. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving on utility bills is a universal concern, especially for financially constrained groups. The quantitative evidence shows that this segment spends a very high proportion of their outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels (76.7%), which strongly reinforces the likelihood that they are motivated to reduce these costs. There is no evidence of digital or environmental attitudes overriding this cost focus. Demographically, this segment ('constrained pensioners') is likely older and on a fixed income, which further increases cost-consciousness (elderly calibration: +4pp for cost-consciousness). Therefore, agreement is slightly above the already high baseline. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and clear semantic fit.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.86
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is well justified and grounded in the provided evidence. The topline quantitative data for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' (31% agreement) is highly relevant and provides a strong anchor for the likely upper bound of agreement with 'fuel consumption is the most important feature.' The insurance and pet care research items, both with lower agreement, further support the conclusion that single-feature prioritization is rare in this segment. The rationale consistently explains why the 'most important' framing leads to lower agreement, even among cost-conscious, constrained pensioners. The repeated use of a 19% agreement estimate (6% strongly agree, 13% slightly agree) is consistent with the evidence and the semantic category baseline. The confidence is appropriately high due to the strong quantitative anchors and clear demographic fit. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 6.00%
  Slightly agree: 13.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 30.00%
  Strongly disagree: 25.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=26.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments (category 5, baseline ~15% agreement). The statement 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' is about prioritizing a single (cost-related) feature in a high-cost purchase, which typically sees low agreement due to the diversity of priorities (e.g., price, reliability, brand, comfort). Quantitative evidence from a similar segment (ACORN Constrained Pensioners) shows only 31% agreement for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' as important when buying a car, which is a related but slightly more niche concern. For this segment, cost sensitivity is high, but the evidence suggests that even among cost-conscious groups, 'most important' is a high bar and agreement remains low. Demographically, this group is older and constrained, so cost matters, but the 'most important' framing keeps agreement low. Distribution is slightly above the baseline for expensive purchases, but still low overall. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments (category 5, baseline ~15% agreement). The statement 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' is about prioritizing a single (cost-related) feature in a high-cost purchase context. For 'Constrained Pensioners', cost is important, but the quantitative evidence for similar 'important when buying a car: environmentally friendly/low CO2' is only 31% agreement, and insurance importance is even lower (11%). This suggests that even among cost-conscious, financially constrained groups, agreement that any single feature is 'most important' is low, as other factors (price, reliability, comfort, etc.) compete. The baseline for expensive purchases is 15% agreement, but the cost-consciousness of this segment and the partial relevance of fuel economy (as a running cost) justifies a slight upward adjustment. However, the evidence shows that even for environmental or insurance features, agreement is low. Therefore, I estimate agreement (SA+A) at 19%, with a high proportion of neutrality and disagreement, reflecting the diversity of priorities in car buying. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear category fit.
Run 3: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments (car buying, prioritizing a specific feature). Baseline for this category is low agreement (~15%) because most people do not prioritize a single feature, especially among constrained pensioners who may have limited choice and focus on price or necessity over ideals. Quantitative evidence shows only 31% agree that 'environmentally friendly/low CO2' is important when buying a car (relevance 0.98), and only 11% agree that 'being well insured for everything' is important (relevance 0.83). These are both lower than the already low baseline, suggesting even less agreement for a single feature like fuel consumption being 'the most important.' Demographically, constrained pensioners are highly price-sensitive, but the statement asks about 'most important' (not just 'important'), which further reduces agreement. Therefore, agreement is estimated at 19% (6% strongly agree, 13% slightly agree), with a large portion neutral or disagreeing. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors.
Run 4: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments (category 5, ~15% agreement baseline). The statement 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' is about prioritizing a single (cost-related) feature in a high-cost purchase, which typically sees low agreement, especially among constrained/low-income segments who may have other priorities (e.g., price, reliability, comfort). Quantitative evidence from a highly relevant segment (ACORN Constrained Pensioners) shows only 31% agreement for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' as important when buying a car, which is a similar but slightly more niche concern. The insurance importance (11%) and pet care research (17%) further confirm low prioritization of single features in expensive purchases. Demographically, this segment is likely to be highly price-sensitive, but 'most important' is a strong claim, so agreement remains low. Distribution is slightly higher than the insurance baseline due to the cost-saving aspect of fuel consumption, but still low overall. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear semantic fit.
Run 5: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=24.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' is about prioritizing a single (cost-related) feature in a high-cost purchase context. For 'Constrained Pensioners', cost is important, but the evidence shows that even environmentally-friendly/low CO2 (a related cost/environmental feature) is only prioritized by 31% (quantitative, highly relevant). Insurance importance is even lower (11%). This suggests that, for this segment, while cost matters, very few will say fuel consumption is the single most important feature—other factors (price, reliability, comfort, etc.) compete. Therefore, agreement is low, with most people either neutral or disagreeing. The distribution is anchored by the 31% for environmental/low CO2 (which is a more general virtue signal than direct cost-saving), so 'fuel consumption is most important' will be even lower. Category baseline (Expensive Purchases) is 15% agreement, but evidence supports a slightly higher value for this cost-conscious segment, so agreement is set at 19%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is well justified based on the provided evidence. The rationale consistently links the target concept to the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, and the topline quantitative evidence (notably, only 16.5% agreeing with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money') robustly supports the inference of moderate risk aversion. The repeated use of the same distribution across runs is appropriate given the lack of evidence for unusually high or low debt aversion in this segment. The absence of demographic calibration is also justified due to lack of specifics. The qualitative evidence is acknowledged but not over-weighted, which is methodologically sound given its lower relevance. Overall, the estimate is sufficiently grounded in the evidence and does not require revision.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 12.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 16.5% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting risk aversion is common), and the overall agreement with strong attitudes (e.g., climate change as a threat) is also low (21%). The segment shows low engagement in community and low likelihood to move, both consistent with risk-averse, stability-seeking attitudes. No evidence suggests this group is unusually debt-tolerant or debt-averse compared to the baseline. Demographic calibrations are not applied due to lack of specifics. Confidence is high due to strong relevance of the risk attitude evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~43% (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 16.5% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting risk aversion is common), and only 21% agree that 'climate change is the biggest threat to civilisation' (showing generally low agreement rates in this segment). The segment is likely cautious and not highly aspirational, so the baseline is appropriate. No strong demographic calibration is indicated by the evidence. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative support for risk aversion.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~43%. Quantitative evidence from the segment shows low risk appetite (only 16.5% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money'), supporting a moderate but not high aversion to financial risk and debt. Other evidence (e.g., low community engagement, low climate concern) does not directly affect debt attitudes. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Therefore, the baseline is maintained, with a slight tilt toward agreement but not overwhelming, matching the evidence and category pattern.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA+A). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 16.5% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting risk aversion is common), and the segment shows low agreement with progressive or risk-taking attitudes (e.g., only 21% agree climate change is the biggest threat, only 7% help out in the community). There is no evidence of unusually high debt aversion or risk-seeking, so the baseline is appropriate. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. The distribution is thus: SA 18%, A 25%, N 25%, D 20%, SD 12%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~43% (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 16.5% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting risk aversion is common), and the overall pattern in this segment shows low agreement with risk-taking and community engagement. There is no evidence of unusually high or low debt aversion in this group, so the category baseline is appropriate. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence on risk aversion.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.79
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I am very good at managing money' among Constrained Pensioners is well justified. The rationale consistently references both the semantic category (Self-Reliance Identity) and the specific characteristics of the segment, using relevant quantitative evidence: low online savings management (19%) and high miscellaneous spending, both of which plausibly indicate lower financial confidence. The adjustment from a general population baseline (60% agreement) to a lower agreement level (46-50%) is reasonable and transparently explained. The qualitative profile is also considered. The evidence selection is balanced, and the downward adjustment is proportional to the segment's constraints. No major gaps or overstatements are present. The justification is sufficient and methodologically sound.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 29.60%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 18.80%
  Strongly disagree: 11.60%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Semantic category: Self-Reliance Identity. The statement 'I am very good at managing money' is a positive self-concept/competence claim, which typically sees moderate-to-high agreement due to social desirability bias and the tendency for people to rate themselves above average in such domains. The baseline for this category is 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 20% neither, 12% slightly disagree, 8% strongly disagree (60% agreement). However, the segment is 'Constrained Pensioners', who are likely to have limited financial resources and may feel less confident about their money management skills. Quantitative evidence shows low engagement with online savings management (19%), high spending on miscellaneous goods/services (suggesting less control), and only moderate car ownership (66%). These suggest slightly lower self-assessed competence than the general population. Therefore, I adjust the agreement downward by about 10pp, resulting in 50% agreement (18% SA, 32% A), and increase the neutral/disagree shares. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant segment evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Self-Reliance Identity (statements about personal competence/responsibility). Baseline for this category is 60% agreement (SA 25%, A 35%). However, the segment is 'Constrained Pensioners', who are typically older, lower-income, and may feel less financial control. Quantitative evidence shows only 19% manage savings online (suggesting lower financial confidence/engagement), and qualitative profile suggests financial constraint. Therefore, I reduce agreement by ~10pp from baseline, shifting more to neutral/disagree. Final: SA 18%, A 32%, N 22%, D 18%, SD 10%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees moderate agreement (~60%) due to social desirability and positive self-concept. However, the segment is 'Constrained Pensioners,' who are likely to have limited financial resources and may experience financial stress. Quantitative evidence shows low engagement with online savings management (19%) and a high share of outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services, suggesting less financial confidence and capability. Therefore, the baseline (SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%) is adjusted downward to reflect this segment's likely lower self-assessed financial competence. The resulting estimate is: SA 18%, A 28%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 12%. Confidence is high due to strong segment fit and relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees moderate agreement (~60%) due to social desirability and positive self-concept. However, the segment is 'Constrained Pensioners,' who are likely to have lower financial confidence and more financial stress. Quantitative evidence shows low online savings management (19%) and high spending on miscellaneous goods/services, suggesting less financial control or confidence. Therefore, I adjust the baseline downward, resulting in a distribution with lower agreement (46% agree, 32% disagree) than the general population. This reflects both the semantic category and the segment's specific financial constraints.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category (baseline: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%, ~60% agreement). However, the segment is 'Constrained Pensioners,' a group likely to have lower financial confidence due to limited resources and higher financial stress. Quantitative evidence shows low engagement with online savings management (19%) and high spending on miscellaneous goods/services, suggesting less financial control or confidence. Therefore, I adjust the baseline downward, especially reducing 'strongly agree' and 'slightly agree' while increasing 'disagree' and 'strongly disagree.' The final estimate reflects a moderate but below-average self-assessed money management confidence for this segment.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.86
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently anchors the prediction to the most relevant quantitative evidence ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', 19% agreement, high relevance), which is a strong proxy for attitudes toward high-cost, risk-mitigation behaviors like comprehensive insurance. The semantic category ('Expensive Purchases/Commitments') is appropriately applied, and the low baseline agreement is well-supported by both the quantitative topline and the broader attitudinal context (price sensitivity, mass-market orientation). The lack of contradictory qualitative or demographic evidence is correctly noted. The distribution (SA 4%, A 13%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 23%) is reasonable and reflects the evidence. Confidence is high due to the clear alignment between the evidence and the estimate.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 4.00%
  Slightly agree: 13.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 23.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') fits the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) due to the cost barrier and lack of universal priority. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.19), which is a similar high-cost, risk-mitigation attitude and shows only 19% agreement. Other evidence (adverts for cinema/soft drinks, mass market clothing) is less relevant but suggests a low engagement with premium or risk-averse behaviors. No qualitative evidence is available to contradict this. The distribution is thus anchored to the category baseline (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%), with a slight upward adjustment for the quantitative evidence (19% agreement on a similar item). Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and clear semantic fit.
Run 2: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which typically sees low agreement (~15%) due to cost barriers and the non-universality of prioritizing comprehensive insurance. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.19, relevance 0.98), which is a similar high-cost, risk-mitigation attitude and confirms low agreement. Other evidence (adverts on cinema/soft drinks, mass market clothing) is less relevant but does not contradict the low baseline. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence suggests deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%), with a slight upward adjustment for the quantitative evidence (0.19) but not enough to shift the category. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between the semantic category and the quantitative topline.
Run 3: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) due to the cost barrier and the fact that comprehensive insurance is not a universal priority. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.19), which is a similar high-cost, risk-mitigation attitude and shows only 19% agreement. Other evidence (adverts for cinema/soft drinks, mass market clothing) is less relevant but suggests a generally price-sensitive, mass-market segment, reinforcing low willingness to prioritize expensive commitments. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence suggests a higher baseline. Therefore, the estimate is close to the category baseline, slightly adjusted upward to match the quantitative evidence (19%), and distributed with a high 'neither' and 'disagree' share, reflecting the attitudinal ambivalence and cost aversion typical for this segment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') fits the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) due to the universal cost barrier and the fact that insurance is a significant, ongoing financial commitment. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.19), which is a similar high-cost, risk-mitigation attitude and shows only 19% agreement. Other evidence (adverts for cinema/soft drinks, mass market clothing) is less relevant but suggests a generally price-sensitive, mass-market segment, which would further depress agreement for expensive, comprehensive insurance. No demographic calibration is warranted as the segment appears constrained and cost-conscious. Therefore, the estimate is anchored to the category baseline (15% agreement), slightly adjusted upward to 17% by the quantitative evidence, and the remainder distributed conservatively across neutral and disagreement. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) due to the cost barrier and lack of universal priority. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.19), which is also a high-cost, risk-mitigation attitude and aligns closely with the insurance concept. This supports the baseline. Other evidence (adverts for cinema/soft drinks, mass market clothing) is less relevant but suggests a mainstream, price-sensitive segment, not one that over-indexes on insurance. No demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline: SA 4%, A 13%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 23%. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between the concept and the quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes is sufficiently justified based on the provided evidence. The quantitative toplines clearly show that only a small minority of the segment are vegan or vegetarian, with the vast majority eating meat. This supports the rationale that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual behavior does not reflect strong commitment to restrictive or health-focused diets. The estimate aligns with the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category baseline, and the repeated rationales consistently link the quantitative evidence to the moderate agreement levels. No major demographic or qualitative evidence contradicts this approach. The justification is clear, methodologically sound, and confidence is high due to the strong alignment between evidence and estimate.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 26.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows very low rates of vegan (2.8%) and vegetarian (3.2%) diets, with a large majority (77%) eating meat. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary behaviors do not reflect strong commitment to plant-based or restrictive healthy diets. This aligns with the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category (~38% agreement baseline). The evidence is highly relevant (relevance >0.95) and indicates that agreement with healthy eating as an attitude is moderate, not high. Therefore, the estimate is close to the category baseline, with a slight downward adjustment due to the strong behavioral evidence of low adoption of healthy eating patterns. No major demographic calibration is warranted based on the provided context.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows that only a small minority are vegan (2.8%) or vegetarian (3.2%), with the vast majority (77%) eating meat and 17.6% in pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. According to the learned semantic categories, 'Healthy Eating' falls under 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' (~38% agreement baseline: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%). The quantitative evidence supports this moderate agreement, as most do not practice strict healthy eating, but some interest is present. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence provided is about actual eating behaviors (meat-eating, veganism, vegetarianism, etc.) in the 'constrained pensioners' segment. The vast majority (77%) eat meat, and only a small minority are vegan (3%) or vegetarian (3%), with 18% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual adoption of restrictive or health-focused diets is low. According to the V6 semantic categories, 'Healthy Eating' as an attitude falls under 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' (~38% agreement baseline). The strong behavioral evidence of low adoption of healthy eating patterns in this segment justifies a downward adjustment from the baseline, as attitudes are likely to be aspirational but not strongly held. Therefore, the estimate is: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows that only a small minority are vegan (2.8%) or vegetarian (3.2%), with the vast majority (77%) eating meat and 17.6% in pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive health-focused diets. The semantic category is 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' (baseline: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%). The evidence supports this moderate agreement: there is some aspiration, but not widespread adoption of health-driven eating patterns. No strong demographic calibration is warranted as the evidence is highly relevant and directly overrides the generic baseline. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative support.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is best classified as a Health-Conscious Attitude (Category 6), which has a baseline of ~38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows that only a small minority are vegan (2.8%) or vegetarian (3.2%), with the vast majority (77%) eating meat, and 17.6% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary change is limited, supporting the moderate baseline. There is no strong evidence of higher or lower agreement than the category baseline, so the default distribution is used. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence aligning with the semantic category.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for agreement with 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' among Constrained Pensioners is well justified. The rationale consistently references the semantic category baseline (Self-Reliance Identity, ~60% agreement), and then appropriately adjusts downward based on the quantitative evidence: very low intent to use other investments for retirement (0.10), moderate saving for a specific purpose (0.35), and moderate attitudes toward proactive financial behaviors. The qualitative profile of 'Constrained Pensioners' is also considered, supporting the adjustment. The distribution of responses (SA+A=55%, N=22%, D+SD=23%) is consistent with the evidence and the reasoning is transparent. No major gaps or misinterpretations are present. The evidence selection is balanced and relevant. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 22.00%
  Slightly agree: 32.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 14.00%
  Strongly disagree: 9.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=22.00%, Slightly agree=33.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=14.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is an attitude about personal responsibility, which is generally high due to social desirability and positive self-concept. However, the segment is 'Constrained Pensioners'—a group likely to have limited financial means and possibly less confidence in their ability to secure retirement, which could slightly reduce agreement. Quantitative evidence shows low intent to use other investments for retirement (0.10), suggesting low proactive behavior, but this does not directly contradict the attitude of responsibility. Other attitudes (e.g., saving for a specific purpose at 0.35, switching utilities at 0.29) are moderate, indicating a somewhat cautious and constrained mindset. Therefore, I slightly reduce the baseline agreement from 60% to 55% (SA 22%, A 33%), increase neutrality, and keep disagreement moderate. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=22.00%, Slightly agree=33.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is a positive self-concept statement about personal responsibility. However, the segment is 'Constrained Pensioners'—a group with limited financial means and likely lower confidence in their ability to secure retirement. Quantitative evidence shows only 10% plan to use other investments for retirement (very low), and only 35% save for a specific purpose, suggesting lower proactive financial engagement. These data points indicate that while the attitude of self-reliance is socially desirable, actual confidence and agreement may be somewhat suppressed in this segment. Therefore, I reduce the baseline agreement from 60% to 55% (SA 22%, A 33%), and increase neutrality/disagreement accordingly. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=22.00%, Slightly agree=33.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=14.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Self-Reliance Identity (statements about personal responsibility). Baseline for this category is 25% SA, 35% A, 20% N, 12% D, 8% SD (60% agreement). Demographic: 'Constrained Pensioners' are likely to feel pressure to be self-reliant due to limited resources, but may also feel less empowered, so agreement may be slightly below general population. Quantitative evidence: Related attitudes (e.g., 'I only save for a specific purpose' at 35%, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 29%) suggest lower-than-average agreement for effortful or aspirational financial attitudes in this group. Therefore, I adjust the baseline downward by ~5pp, resulting in 22% SA, 33% A, 22% N, 14% D, 9% SD. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=22.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=15.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is a positive self-concept/competence statement, but the segment ('Constrained Pensioners') is likely to feel less empowered and more financially constrained, which may reduce agreement somewhat. Quantitative evidence shows only 10% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting low financial agency), and only moderate agreement with related self-directed financial attitudes (e.g., 35% only save for a specific purpose, 29% think switching utilities is worth the effort). These suggest a lower-than-baseline sense of financial agency. Therefore, I reduce the baseline agreement by about 6pp, shifting some to 'neither' and 'disagree'. The result is a moderate majority agreeing, but with a significant neutral/disagree minority. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=22.00%, Slightly agree=33.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=14.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is a positive self-concept/competence statement, and social desirability bias is likely. However, the segment is 'Constrained Pensioners'—a group with limited means and likely lower confidence in their ability to self-provide for retirement. Quantitative evidence shows only 10% plan to use other investments for retirement (very low), and only 35% save for a specific purpose, suggesting lower-than-average self-reliance in practice. Therefore, I adjust the baseline downward by about 5pp, resulting in 55% agreement (SA+A). The rest is distributed with a slightly higher neutral and disagreement, reflecting uncertainty and possible resignation in this segment. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is well justified and methodologically sound. The rationale consistently links the segment's demographic characteristics (older, lower income, likely less digitally confident) with the semantic category of 'Effort-Required Behaviors,' which is known to have low agreement rates. Quantitative evidence (high utility outgoings, low participation in out-of-home activities) is appropriately used to infer cost sensitivity but also low behavioral engagement, supporting the downward adjustment from the baseline. The qualitative profile of 'Constrained Pensioners' is referenced to reinforce the expectation of inertia and risk aversion. The topline estimates are consistent across runs, and the adjustments are transparently explained. No corrective feedback is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 7.00%
  Slightly agree: 20.60%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 29.00%
  Slightly disagree: 26.00%
  Strongly disagree: 17.40%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=21.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=29.00%, Slightly disagree=26.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' falls under the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~30% (SA 8%, A 22%). This is because switching utilities, while potentially cost-saving, is widely perceived as requiring significant time and hassle, especially among older or less digitally confident populations. The segment 'Constrained Pensioners' is likely older, lower income, and less digitally engaged, which further reduces willingness to engage in effortful behaviors. Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting cost pressure), but extremely low participation in out-of-home activities (sporting events 14%, places of worship 8%), indicating low engagement and possibly low energy for extra tasks. Therefore, agreement is likely even lower than the baseline for effortful behaviors, with higher neutrality and disagreement. Distribution is adjusted downward to reflect this segment's characteristics.
Run 2: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=21.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=29.00%, Slightly disagree=26.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: Semantic category: This concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits Category 7: Effort-Required Behaviors. It asks about willingness to engage in a time/effort-intensive activity (switching suppliers), which typically sees low agreement due to inertia and perceived hassle, even if there is a potential cost saving. Baseline for this category is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 25% slightly disagree, 15% strongly disagree (30% agreement).

Demographic calibration: The segment is 'Constrained Pensioners'—likely older, lower-income, and risk-averse. Older age increases cost-consciousness but also increases effort aversion and resistance to change, especially for complex tasks like switching utilities. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting salience), but very low participation in out-of-home activities (sporting events 14%, places of worship 8%), indicating low engagement and possibly low energy for effortful tasks. This supports a slightly higher 'neither' and 'disagree' response.

Adjustment: Slightly reduce agreement (from baseline) and increase 'neither' and 'disagree' due to segment's likely inertia and risk aversion. Final estimate: 7% strongly agree, 21% slightly agree, 29% neither, 26% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree. Confidence is high due to strong fit with category and segment evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=20.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') falls under the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category, which typically sees low agreement (~30%) due to time/effort aversion, especially among older or less affluent groups. The segment 'Constrained Pensioners' is likely older, lower-income, and possibly less digitally confident, further reducing willingness to engage in effortful switching. Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting salience), but very low engagement in out-of-home activities (e.g., sporting events 14%, places of worship 8%), supporting the idea of low activity/engagement. No direct evidence suggests higher-than-baseline agreement. Therefore, the estimate is slightly below the category baseline: SA 7%, A 20%, N 28%, D 27%, SD 18%. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment characteristics and the semantic category.
Run 4: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=20.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' falls under the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category, which typically sees low agreement (~30%) because it requires significant time and effort, and many people are effort-averse even if there is a potential cost saving. The segment 'Constrained Pensioners' is likely to be especially effort-averse due to age, lower digital confidence, and possible inertia, despite high outgoings on utilities (which could motivate switching). Quantitative evidence shows high spending on council tax, utilities, and related bills, but this does not translate directly into willingness to switch, as the behavioral barrier remains high. The baseline for this category is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. For this older, constrained segment, I adjust slightly downward: more in 'disagree' and 'strongly disagree', less in 'agree', reflecting greater inertia and lower digital/market engagement. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the effort-required pattern and supporting qualitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=21.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=29.00%, Slightly disagree=26.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Effort-Required Behaviors. The statement 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' requires not just a positive attitude but willingness to take action that involves time, hassle, and perceived risk. For the 'Constrained Pensioners' segment, quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on council tax, utilities, and related bills, indicating cost sensitivity. However, actual behavioral data (e.g., low rates of visiting sporting events or places of worship) suggests low engagement in non-essential activities, likely due to age, inertia, and risk aversion. The effort required to switch utilities is a known barrier, especially for older or less digitally confident groups. Baseline for this category is 30% agreement (Effort-Required Behaviors). For this segment (older, lower income), inertia and risk aversion likely reduce agreement further, so I slightly increase 'disagree' and 'neither' at the expense of 'agree'. Quantitative evidence does not show high switching rates, so no override. Confidence is high due to strong fit with category and segment profile.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The topline quantitative evidence shows very low online purchase rates for everyday categories among 'Constrained Pensioners,' strongly supporting the inference of a higher-than-average preference for cash. The demographic calibration (older, lower-income, less digitally engaged) is appropriately applied, and the rationale for shifting agreement upwards is well-grounded in both the quantitative and qualitative evidence. The distribution reflects a realistic mix of agreement, neutrality, and some disagreement, acknowledging that not all in this group are cash-preferring. The confidence is high due to the strong alignment between the evidence and the predicted distribution.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 12.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The target concept ('I like to use cash when making purchases') fits the payment preference category, which has a moderate baseline agreement (~37%). However, the segment is 'Constrained Pensioners,' who are typically older, lower-income, and less digitally engaged. Quantitative evidence shows very low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 17%, pet care 21%), indicating a strong preference for offline/cash transactions. Demographic calibration: For elderly/low-income, increase agreement by +5pp. Therefore, agreement is higher than the general population baseline. Distribution is shifted toward agreement, but not overwhelmingly so, as some in this group may still use cards for convenience. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment characteristics and evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The target concept ('I like to use cash when making purchases') fits the payment method preference category, which has a baseline agreement of ~37%. However, the segment is 'Constrained Pensioners,' a group likely to be older, lower income, and less digitally engaged. Quantitative evidence shows very low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 17%, pet care 21%), indicating a strong preference for offline and likely cash-based transactions. Demographic calibration: Elderly (+5pp for cash preference), low income (+2pp). Therefore, agreement is notably higher than the general population baseline, but not universal, as some digital adoption exists. Distribution is shifted toward agreement, but with a substantial neutral and some disagreement reflecting ongoing digital transition.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The target group is 'Constrained Pensioners,' who are typically older, lower-income, and less digitally engaged. Quantitative evidence shows very low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 17%, pet care 21%), indicating a strong preference for offline/cash transactions. The baseline for cash preference is ~37% agreement, but for this segment, age and digital exclusion suggest a higher preference for cash. Therefore, agreement is increased by ~3-5pp. The distribution reflects a moderate but not overwhelming preference for cash, with a significant minority neutral or disagreeing due to some digital adoption. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment characteristics and evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The target concept ('I like to use cash when making purchases') fits the payment preference category, which typically sees moderate agreement (~35-40%) in the general population. However, the segment is 'Constrained Pensioners,' who are older, lower-income, and more likely to prefer cash due to habit, access, and budgeting needs. Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcohol 17%, pet care 21%), indicating a strong offline/cash preference. Demographic calibration: For elderly/low-income, agreement is increased (+5pp), but the evidence of very low online adoption suggests even higher cash preference. Therefore, agreement is set at 40% (18% SA, 22% A), with a moderate neutral (28%) and lower disagreement (20% SD, 12% D). Confidence is high due to strong alignment between evidence and category.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The target group is 'Constrained Pensioners,' who are older, lower-income, and likely to have traditional payment habits. The baseline for cash preference is ~37% agreement (SA+A), but for elderly/low-income, calibration adds +5pp, raising expected agreement to ~42%. However, strong quantitative evidence shows very low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcohol 17%, pet care 21%), indicating a strong preference for offline/cash transactions. This supports a higher-than-baseline agreement. Distribution is skewed toward agreement, but not overwhelmingly so, as some in this group may still use cards or be neutral. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between demographic profile and quantitative evidence.
