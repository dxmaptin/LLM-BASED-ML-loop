### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.70
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale for applying the V4 baseline attitude template is sound: the quantitative toplines (country of birth, account management method) are not directly relevant to the attitude concept in question, and the qualitative notes do not provide strong, concept-specific direction. There is no evidence suggesting a need for demographic calibration or deviation from the baseline. The repeated application of the baseline across runs, with consistent rationale and moderate confidence, is appropriate in the absence of more targeted evidence. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline template is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no evidence of a concept-specific correction or strong demographic calibration needed, as the quantitative evidence provided relates to account management and country of birth but does not indicate a need for deviation from the general attitude baseline. The evidence hierarchy prioritizes direct quantitative data, but the values (e.g., 0.03, 0.17) are not directly relevant to the attitude concept, so they do not warrant adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct anchor or concept-specific data.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the V4 baseline template is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided is not directly related to the target concept (it covers country of birth and account management methods), so it does not justify deviation from the baseline. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the general attitude baseline is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated for a generic 'Concept'. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account by phone' at 17%) is not directly relevant to a general attitude item, and the qualitative notes are minimal. No demographic calibration is warranted, as the segment data (e.g., 'Country of Birth: Rest of Europe' at 3%) does not indicate a need for adjustment. Therefore, the general attitude baseline is most appropriate. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence for the specific concept.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated, and the demographic quantitative evidence provided (e.g., country of birth, account management by phone) is not directly relevant to the attitude concept in question, nor does it suggest a need for demographic calibration. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the general V4 attitude template is used. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence for the specific concept.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no evidence of strong demographic deviation in the quantitative toplines (all values are low, e.g., 0.03–0.17), and no qualitative evidence suggesting a shift from the general population. No concept-specific correction is indicated. Therefore, the general V4 attitude template is used. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct concept anchoring.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.86
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence: only 12% of the segment self-identify as environmentalists and 34% agree that energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating low environmental engagement. The V4 baseline is appropriately used, with some runs exploring a slight downward adjustment in agreement to reflect the segment's even lower-than-average environmental concern. The absence of qualitative evidence is noted, but the high relevance and strength of the quantitative data compensate for this. The justification is methodologically sound, with clear alignment between evidence and prediction, and no unwarranted demographic calibration. No corrective feedback is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 7.60%
  Slightly agree: 20.40%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.80%
  Slightly disagree: 23.80%
  Strongly disagree: 17.40%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), reflecting a systematic over-prediction in V3 that has been corrected. Quantitative evidence from this segment shows only 12% consider themselves environmentalists and 34% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating low environmental engagement. No evidence suggests this segment is more pro-environmental than the general population, so no upward demographic calibration is warranted. The prediction is therefore anchored to the V4 corrected baseline for this concept type, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 cross-class analysis shows this item is systematically over-predicted (+15pp in V3), so the corrected baseline is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 23%, SD 17% (30% agreement). Segment quantitative evidence shows only 12% consider themselves environmentalists and 34% are skeptical of energy companies' environmental care, both indicating low environmental engagement. No evidence suggests this segment is more pro-environment than the general population. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, with no upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class consistency.
Run 3: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence shows only 12% consider themselves environmentalists and 34% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating low environmental engagement in this segment. This supports a slightly lower agreement than the V4 baseline. The segment is 'Tenant Living', which typically skews younger and less affluent, but the low environmentalist self-ID suggests little upward demographic calibration is warranted. Therefore, I slightly reduce agreement: 7% strongly agree, 18% slightly agree (25% total), and increase neutrality/disagreement. This is consistent with both the V4 correction and the segment's low environmental concern. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events. V4 cross-class analysis shows this concept is systematically over-predicted, so the baseline is sharply reduced (now 30% agreement: SA 8%, A 22%). For this segment (ACORN Tenant Living), the quantitative evidence shows very low self-identification as environmentalist (12%) and moderate skepticism toward energy companies (34% agree they don't care about the environment). These values are both below the national average and suggest environmental concern is not a strong identity or priority for this group. Therefore, I further reduce agreement by 3pp (relative to V4 baseline) and increase neutrality/disagreement. The final estimate is: SA 7%, A 18%, N 32%, D 25%, SD 18%. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence and the high consistency of the V4 correction for this concept.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), due to systematic over-prediction in V3 and cross-class consistency error (+15pp). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows only 12% consider themselves environmentalists and 34% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating low environmental engagement. No evidence suggests this segment is more pro-environmental than average, so no upward demographic calibration is warranted. The distribution is therefore set at the V4 corrected baseline for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class correction.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.98
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the V4 guidance that this concept ('make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home') is well-calibrated and should use the general population baseline (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%). The quantitative evidence from the segment (Tenant Living) does not indicate a strong deviation from this baseline: while outgoings on housing/utilities are high, there is no direct evidence of unusually high or low pro-environmental or cost-saving attitudes. The closest available attitude ('support local businesses') is low, but this is not directly analogous. The qualitative and digital attitudes do not contradict the baseline. The repeated application of the V4 template is appropriate given the evidence hierarchy and the lack of contradictory or segment-specific evidence. Confidence is high due to the strong alignment with the evidence and calibration guidance.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.00%
  Slightly agree: 40.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 15.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ("make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home"). V4 guidance indicates this is a well-calibrated concept (error <3pp), so the baseline should be kept at SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment (Tenant Living) shows high outgoings on housing/utilities, which may increase salience of energy-saving attitudes, but the quantitative topline for a similar attitude ('I make an effort to support local businesses') is low (15%), suggesting generally low pro-social self-reporting in this group. However, the concept-specific V4 baseline is robust and well-calibrated, and no strong evidence suggests a need for downward adjustment. Therefore, the standard distribution is used, with high confidence due to strong quantitative calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a low-friction behavior but is treated as a well-calibrated concept in V4 (no systematic error, so keep V3 values). The segment ('Tenant Living') shows high outgoings on housing and utilities, which increases the likelihood of cost-consciousness and efforts to reduce usage. However, the quantitative evidence for pro-environmental or cost-saving attitudes is only moderate (e.g., 15% agree with supporting local businesses, 32% like chat bots, 15% are confused by computers). There is no evidence of unusually high or low agreement with energy-saving behaviors, so the general population baseline is appropriate. Therefore, I use the V4 baseline for this concept: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative calibration and lack of segment-specific deviation.
Run 3: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ("Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home"). According to V4, this item is well-calibrated and should use the general template: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. The segment's quantitative and qualitative evidence does not indicate a strong deviation from the baseline: their outgoings on utilities are not unusually high or low, and there is no evidence of strong pro- or anti-environmental sentiment. The closest attitude (supporting local businesses) is low (15%), but this is a different domain and does not justify lowering the baseline. Therefore, the general population distribution is applied. Confidence is high due to direct template match and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ("make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home"). According to V4, this is a well-calibrated concept and should use the general template: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment's quantitative data shows high outgoings on housing/utilities (suggesting salience of energy costs), but no evidence of unusually high or low pro-environmental attitudes. The qualitative and digital attitudes do not indicate a strong deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the general V4 template is applied without demographic or concept-specific adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ("make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home"), and the V4 baseline for this item is well-calibrated at 70% agreement (30% SA, 40% A). Quantitative evidence from the segment shows moderate digital engagement and low affinity for new tech, but nothing to suggest a deviation from the general population on this specific attitude. Outgoings on housing/utilities are not unusually high or low, and there is no evidence of systematic under- or over-prediction for this concept in V3 or V4. Therefore, the general V4 template is applied without demographic adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the well-calibrated baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence ('Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions', value=0.38) and correctly notes that this is related but not identical to the target concept ('fuel consumption is the most important feature'). The estimate applies the V4 corrected baseline, which is appropriate given the moderate relevance of the available evidence and the known tendency for over-prediction in previous versions. The lack of qualitative evidence is acknowledged, and the absence of demographic or attitudinal outliers is correctly used to avoid unnecessary calibration. The repeated, consistent application of the evidence and the clear mapping between evidence and estimate support a high-confidence, well-grounded prediction. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 25.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the context and quantitative toplines indicate this is a relatively low-priority concern for this segment. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action metric: 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.38), which is closely related but not identical to fuel consumption. This value (0.38) suggests that only about 38% of the segment rate environmental factors as important, and fuel consumption is likely a subset of this. The V4 template for this concept (after correcting for systematic over-prediction) is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). This matches the evidence and is supported by the low agreement on related attitudes (e.g., only 10% agree with 'well insured for everything'). No qualitative evidence suggests a higher valuation of fuel consumption. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.38), which is closely related but not identical—environmental concern overlaps with fuel consumption, but is not a perfect proxy. The V4 baseline for this concept (after correcting for systematic over-prediction) is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The segment's quantitative topline (0.38) is slightly above the general population mean for this item, but not enough to warrant a demographic calibration (which would be +2pp at most, and V4 reduces these by 50%). The other evidence (attitudes toward energy companies, insurance, and online research) is less directly relevant. Therefore, the general V4 baseline is applied with no significant upward or downward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and clear concept mapping.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' V4 baseline for this concept is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting a systematic over-prediction in V3 that has been corrected by -5pp. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the segment's agreement with 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.38), which is moderately related but not identical (environmental concern vs. fuel economy). This supports a low agreement rate, as does the low importance placed on being well insured (value=0.10), suggesting practical/financial features are not top priorities. No qualitative evidence is available to suggest a higher or lower value. The distribution is therefore set at the V4 corrected baseline, with no demographic upweighting, as this segment does not show strong pro-environmental or pro-practical attitudes. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class calibration.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' V4 baseline for this concept (see prompt) is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3 and cross-class consistency. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action topline: 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.38), which is higher than the V4 baseline but not directly about fuel consumption as the single most important feature. The next most relevant is the attitude about energy companies (value=0.34), which suggests moderate environmental concern but not a strong focus on fuel consumption. The segment's insurance and online research scores are low, indicating less risk aversion and less engagement with detailed product features. No qualitative evidence is available. Given the evidence, the V4 baseline is appropriate, as the segment shows only moderate concern for environmental/fuel issues when buying a car, and the concept is known to be over-predicted in prior versions. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied without upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class calibration.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude' but with a high-friction behavioral implication (prioritizing fuel consumption above all else when buying a car). V4 baseline for this concept is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3 and cross-class analysis. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 38%, but this is a broader, less stringent criterion than 'fuel consumption is the most important feature.' The segment's agreement with environmental attitudes is moderate (34%), and the insurance attitude is low (10%), suggesting a pragmatic, not highly idealistic, profile. No demographic calibration is needed (tenant living is not a high- or low-income outlier). Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, with no upward or downward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class consistency.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 attitude baseline, which is described as well-calibrated for this concept. The available quantitative evidence (risk-taking with money, community engagement, climate concern, likelihood to move) is correctly assessed as not directly relevant to debt aversion, but the moderate risk tolerance is appropriately noted as weakly supportive of the baseline. The absence of strong segment-specific evidence is acknowledged, and the decision not to adjust the baseline is justified. The confidence is high due to the direct template match and lack of contradictory evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), so the V4 attitude baseline applies. There is no direct quantitative evidence about debt aversion, but related attitudes (risk-taking with money: 0.26 agree, 0.74 not agree) suggest a cautious financial profile. The segment's low 'helping out in the community' (0.07) and moderate likelihood to move (0.49) do not directly affect debt attitudes. The V4 template for this concept is well-calibrated and should be used as-is: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. No demographic calibration is warranted due to lack of strong segment-specific evidence. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and supporting related quantitative data.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), and the V4 baseline for this item is well-calibrated (43% agreement: 18% SA, 25% A). The segment (ACORN Tenant Living) shows low community engagement (helping out: 7%), moderate concern for climate change (26%), and moderate risk tolerance (26% agree to risk with money). There is no direct evidence of strong anti-debt sentiment, but the moderate risk tolerance suggests some may be less debt-averse than average. However, the V4 template is already well-calibrated for this concept, and there is no strong evidence to shift it up or down. Therefore, I use the V4 baseline for attitudes: 18% SA, 25% A, 22% N, 20% D, 15% SD. Confidence is high due to direct template match and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), so the V4 attitude baseline applies: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, this concept is specifically listed as well-calibrated in V4 (error < 1pp), so the V3 template is retained: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence from the segment shows low agreement with risk-taking (0.26) and low community engagement (0.07), both suggesting a cautious, risk-averse profile, which aligns with a moderate-to-high aversion to debt. No evidence suggests a need to adjust the baseline. Confidence is high due to direct template match and supporting evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude item. V4 guidance indicates this concept is well-calibrated (V3 error: -0.2pp), so the baseline template is retained: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence from this segment shows low community engagement (0.07), moderate concern for climate change (0.26), and moderate risk tolerance (0.26), but none directly relate to debt aversion. No evidence suggests this segment is more or less debt-averse than the general population. Therefore, the general attitude baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct V4 calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude item. According to the V4 baseline, this concept is well-calibrated and should not be adjusted from the V3 template: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The segment (ACORN Tenant Living) shows low community engagement (helping out in the community: 7%), moderate concern for climate change (26%), and moderate risk tolerance (26% willing to take risks with money). There is no direct evidence about debt aversion, but the moderate risk tolerance and lack of strong community or financial conservatism suggest the baseline is appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed, as this is not a high-income or elderly segment. Confidence is high due to the direct match with the well-calibrated baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.78
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I am very good at managing money' is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale consistently references the V4 baseline and its correction for systematic over-prediction in V3, which is methodologically sound. The quantitative evidence (moderate online savings management, car ownership, and outgoings on miscellaneous goods) is appropriately interpreted as indicating neither strong financial confidence nor distress, supporting the use of the V4 corrected baseline without further demographic calibration. The absence of qualitative evidence is acknowledged, and the decision not to adjust further is reasonable. Confidence is high due to the strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the well-calibrated V4 correction. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 24.40%
  Slightly agree: 33.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.40%
  Slightly disagree: 12.40%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=22.00%, Slightly agree=33.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=14.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity-type statement. V4 guidance for this concept is to use the corrected baseline (SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%) due to moderate over-prediction in V3 (+6pp). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows moderate online savings management (21%) and a majority privately own their car (57%), suggesting some financial stability but not high affluence. Outgoings on miscellaneous goods are relatively high (29%), which may indicate less tight budgeting. No qualitative evidence is available to further refine. Given these signals, I slightly reduce 'slightly agree' and increase 'neither' to reflect a moderate but not strong self-perception of money management. This yields 55% agreement (SA+A), slightly below the V4 baseline for this identity concept, in line with the segment's moderate financial profile. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative anchors but lack of direct attitudinal data.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity concepts is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, this specific concept is subject to a moderate correction (-6pp) due to V3's systematic over-prediction (+6.3pp). The corrected V4 allocation is SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows moderate online financial management (21% manage savings online), suggesting some digital engagement but not high sophistication. Outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services are high, which could indicate less tight money management, but this is not definitive. No strong evidence of financial distress or exceptional prudence. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, with no further demographic calibration needed. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and well-calibrated V4 correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for this concept is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), which is already adjusted for the moderate over-prediction found in V3. The quantitative evidence provided is limited but does not indicate either strong financial confidence or distress: 21% manage savings online (suggesting some digital engagement but not universal), and 29% of outgoings are on miscellaneous goods/services (not clearly indicative of poor money management). The car ownership rate (57%) and low worry about car theft (7%) do not directly inform self-perceived money management. No qualitative evidence is available to further adjust. Therefore, the V4 identity baseline is appropriate for this segment, with no further demographic calibration needed. Confidence is moderate-high due to alignment with the corrected baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity concepts is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, V3 systematically over-predicted this concept by +6pp, so V4 reduces agreement to SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows moderate online financial management (21% manage savings online), suggesting digital engagement but not high financial confidence. Outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services are high (29%), which may indicate less tight budgeting, but not necessarily poor money management. No direct evidence suggests a need to deviate from the V4 corrected identity baseline. Therefore, the V4 template for this concept is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and moderate supporting evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity concepts is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, this specific concept has a moderate over-prediction error in V3 (+6.3pp), so V4 reduces agreement by 6pp, resulting in SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). 

The quantitative evidence does not indicate either unusually high or low financial confidence: only 21% manage savings online (suggesting moderate digital engagement), and 57% own their main car (implying some financial stability, but not affluence). Outgoings on miscellaneous goods are moderate. There is no evidence of acute financial distress or exceptional financial acumen. 

No demographic calibration is applied, as the evidence does not indicate high or low income, nor a strong age skew. The qualitative context is missing, so the baseline V4 correction is used. 

Confidence is moderate-high (0.78) due to strong alignment with V4 cross-class correction and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run consistently references the quantitative evidence (low agreement with 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' at 0.15) as an indicator of low prioritization of risk-averse or precautionary attitudes, which aligns with the baseline distribution for the insurance attitude. The repeated use of the well-calibrated V4 baseline is appropriate, and the absence of evidence for higher risk aversion or insurance focus is clearly stated. The evidence selection rationale confirms that both quantitative and qualitative sources were considered, even if the qualitative input was limited. No corrective action is needed; the justification is methodologically sound and well-supported by the provided evidence.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The quantitative evidence from the segment ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' at 0.15) suggests a low tendency to prioritize risk-averse or precautionary attitudes, which aligns with the baseline. There is no evidence of higher-than-average risk aversion or financial conservatism in the segment. No demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment evidence and the well-calibrated baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The quantitative evidence for this segment (ACORN Tenant Living) shows low agreement with similar 'responsibility' or 'prudent' attitudes (e.g., only 15% agree that fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car), suggesting a low prioritization of risk-averse or future-oriented behaviors. There is no evidence of higher-than-average agreement with security or insurance-related attitudes. Therefore, the general baseline is appropriate, and no demographic upweighting is justified. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between the evidence and the V4 baseline.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is an attitude item. According to the V4 prompt, this specific concept is well-calibrated in V3 and should be kept unchanged: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence for this segment (Tenant Living) shows low agreement with 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.15), suggesting a tendency toward practical, cost-conscious attitudes rather than prioritizing comprehensive insurance. There is no evidence of higher-than-average agreement with security or risk-averse attitudes. Therefore, the baseline V4 distribution is appropriate, with no upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and the concept's well-calibrated status in V3/V4.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this item is well-calibrated and should use the baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The quantitative evidence from the segment (fuel consumption as most important feature when buying a car: 0.15) suggests a relatively low prioritization of risk-averse or security-focused attitudes in this group. There is no evidence of unusually high risk aversion or insurance focus in the qualitative or quantitative data. Therefore, the general population baseline is appropriate, with no upward demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative alignment and the well-calibrated nature of this concept in V4.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude'. The target is 'It is important to be well insured for everything.' V4 guidance says this concept is well-calibrated (V3 error +2.9pp), so we use the standard: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. Quantitative evidence from the segment shows low agreement with 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.15), suggesting a pragmatic, cost-conscious audience. No evidence suggests higher agreement with insurance importance. No demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to direct match with V4 template and supporting low agreement on similar 'practical' attitudes.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.98
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' agreement (SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%) is well justified. The rationale consistently references the quantitative evidence: very low vegan (1%) and vegetarian (8%) rates, moderate pescatarian/flexitarian/other (20%), and high meat consumption (69%). This supports the conclusion that strong agreement with healthy eating is likely to be moderate, not high. The application of the V4 correction for systematic over-prediction is appropriate, and the lack of qualitative evidence for higher agreement is correctly noted. No demographic calibration is needed, as the evidence is segment-specific and robust. The confidence is high due to strong alignment between the quantitative data and the corrected topline. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 26.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude type), and V4 mandates a major correction for this item due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3). The corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14% (38% agreement). The quantitative evidence shows very low vegan/vegetarian rates (1%/8%), moderate pescatarian/flexitarian/other (20%), and high meat consumption (69%), which supports the rationale for a lower agreement with 'Healthy Eating' as a value or attitude. No qualitative evidence suggests higher agreement. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class consistency.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this item due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3 across all classes). The corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14% (38% agreement). Quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 8% vegetarian, 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, and 69% eat meat, indicating low prevalence of restrictive healthy eating behaviors. This supports a lower agreement rate. No demographic calibration is needed as this is a general segment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and robust cross-class correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3) across all classes, so the baseline is set at 38% agreement (SA+A). The quantitative evidence shows this segment is overwhelmingly meat-eating (69%), with very low vegan (1%) and vegetarian (8%) rates, and a moderate pescatarian/flexitarian/other (20%). This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. This supports the V4 correction: agreement with 'Healthy Eating' is likely to be moderate, not high. No demographic calibration is needed as the evidence is directly segment-specific. The distribution is thus: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and the V4 cross-class correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major -22pp correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction in all classes. Quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 8% vegetarian, and 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 69% eating meat—indicating low prevalence of restrictive healthy eating behaviors. While the question is about attitude (not behavior), these low numbers suggest that strong agreement with healthy eating is likely below the general population. The V4 corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is 12% strongly agree, 26% slightly agree, 26% neither, 22% slightly disagree, 14% strongly disagree (38% agreement). No demographic calibration is applied, as this is a general tenant/renter segment with no strong evidence for higher/lower agreement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and V4 cross-class correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude), and V4 mandates a major correction (-22pp) due to systematic over-prediction in all classes. The quantitative evidence shows very low vegan/vegetarian rates (1% vegan, 8% vegetarian, 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other), and a high proportion eating meat (69%), suggesting that while some may endorse healthy eating in principle, actual dietary change is rare. This supports a lower agreement rate. The V4 corrected template for 'Healthy Eating' is: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14% (38% agreement), which matches the evidence and corrects for the known bias. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class correction.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.80
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for agreement with 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 baseline for this attitude/identity hybrid concept, which is appropriate given the available evidence. Quantitative data from the ACORN Tenant Living segment shows low proactive retirement planning (11% plan to use other investments), but this does not directly contradict the attitude of personal responsibility—rather, it reflects behavior. Other financial attitudes (saving for a purpose, switching utilities) are moderate, and there is no strong evidence of disengagement or hostility toward financial responsibility. The qualitative notes and run-level detail confirm that the V4 baseline already incorporates necessary corrections for this segment, and no further demographic or behavioral adjustment is warranted. Confidence is high due to the strong alignment between the evidence and the applied baseline. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.00%
  Slightly disagree: 13.00%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' item, but with a strong identity/self-responsibility framing, so the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is used: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows low proactive retirement planning (only 11% plan to use other investments for retirement), and moderate agreement with other financial attitudes (e.g., 35% only save for a specific purpose, 34% think switching utilities is worth the effort). However, the V4 correction for this concept is only -3pp from V3, and the evidence does not suggest a need for further downward adjustment: the segment is not especially disengaged or hostile to financial responsibility, just not proactive. Therefore, the V4 template is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong relevance of the evidence and the well-calibrated V4 baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but closely related to identity and responsibility. V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is 25/35/18/13/9 (60% agreement), reflecting a moderate but not overwhelming sense of personal responsibility in the general population. The segment (ACORN Tenant Living) is likely to have lower financial engagement and less confidence in long-term planning, as evidenced by low intent to use other investments for retirement (11%) and only moderate agreement with proactive financial attitudes (e.g., 35% save for a purpose, 34% think switching utilities is worth it). However, the concept is about attitude, not behavior, and the V4 demographic calibration for lower-income/tenant segments is only +4pp, which is already incorporated in the baseline. No strong evidence suggests a need to deviate from the V4 template. Therefore, the standard V4 distribution for this concept is applied, with moderate confidence due to the lack of direct attitudinal data on retirement responsibility in this segment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but closely related to identity and responsibility. V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is 25/35/18/13/9 (60% agreement), reflecting a moderate but not overwhelming sense of personal responsibility in the general population. The segment (ACORN Tenant Living) shows low intent to use other investments for retirement (11%), and moderate engagement with financial attitudes (saving for purpose: 35%, switching utilities: 34%). No evidence suggests this group is more likely than average to agree with the statement, and demographic calibration is not warranted (no strong age/income signal). Quantitative evidence is limited but does not contradict the baseline. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied without adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 baseline for this item is: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement), as per the systematic correction for this concept (-3pp from V3). The quantitative evidence from this segment shows low intent to use other investments for retirement (0.11), moderate agreement with saving for a specific purpose (0.35), and moderate agreement that switching utilities is worth the effort (0.34). These do not directly contradict the baseline, but the low investment intent suggests this group may be less proactive about retirement, which could slightly reduce agreement. However, the V4 correction already accounts for a slight over-prediction in prior versions. No strong demographic calibration is needed, as this is not a high-income or elderly segment. Therefore, the corrected V4 baseline is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and well-calibrated V4 baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' item, but the V4 prompt specifies to treat 'retirement is your responsibility' as an identity/attitude hybrid, using the corrected baseline: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows low intent to use other investments for retirement (11%), moderate agreement with saving for a specific purpose (35%), and moderate trust in price comparison sites (52%). The closest direct evidence is the low value for alternative retirement investments, which suggests a lack of proactive retirement planning, but this does not directly contradict the sense of personal responsibility. No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the V4 baseline for this concept. Demographic calibrations are not applied, as the segment is not flagged as low-income or elderly. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the V4 template and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.81
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run is consistent and clearly references the evidence hierarchy: the V4 baseline for this attitude is well-calibrated, and the quantitative evidence (moderate outgoings on utilities) does not indicate a need for deviation from the general population template. There is no qualitative or quantitative evidence suggesting higher or lower agreement, nor any demographic factors requiring calibration. The repeated application of the baseline is appropriate, and the confidence level is well-supported by the evidence provided. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'). V4 guidance indicates this item is well-calibrated (V3 error -2.1pp), so the baseline template is retained: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows this segment has moderate outgoings on utilities (council tax, water, etc.), but there is no evidence of unusually high engagement or friction with switching. No demographic calibration is needed. The distribution reflects moderate agreement, with a substantial neutral/disagree segment, matching the general population pattern for this item. Confidence is high due to direct template match and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude (moderate spread). V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement), which is well-calibrated and should be kept unchanged. The segment ('Tenant Living') shows moderate engagement with utilities (high outgoings on council tax/utilities, but no evidence of high switching behavior or strong proactivity). Quantitative evidence does not suggest higher or lower agreement than the general population. No demographic calibration is needed. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated in the general population (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). The segment 'Tenant Living' shows moderate outgoings on utilities and housing, but there is no direct evidence of high engagement or strong attitudes toward switching. The quantitative data (utility outgoings) suggests some salience, but not enough to warrant deviation from the baseline. No qualitative evidence indicates a stronger or weaker attitude than average. Therefore, the general V4 template for this attitude is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to the alignment of segment context with the general population and the absence of evidence for deviation.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 baseline for this is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. There is no evidence in the provided quantitative or qualitative data to suggest a higher or lower level of agreement than the general population baseline. The segment ('Tenant Living') shows moderate outgoings on utilities, but nothing in the data suggests they are more or less likely to agree with the statement than average. No demographic calibration is warranted. The evidence hierarchy is satisfied by the general baseline, and the prediction maintains appropriate variance. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment with the well-calibrated V3/V4 baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 baseline for this item is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. This matches the well-calibrated template for this concept, as V3 error was only -2.1pp and no systematic bias was found. The segment ('Tenant Living') shows moderate engagement with utilities (high outgoings on council tax/utilities, but no evidence of high switching or engagement), and no quantitative or qualitative evidence suggests a deviation from the general population. Therefore, the baseline template is applied without demographic adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 baseline for the 'I like to use cash when making purchases' attitude item, which is already calibrated for this type of segment and concept. The quantitative evidence from the segment (low online purchase rates for everyday items, higher for large/occasional purchases) is directly relevant and supports the baseline, indicating a moderate but not overwhelming preference for cash. The absence of strong qualitative evidence is correctly noted, and no further demographic calibration is warranted. The repeated, consistent application of the evidence hierarchy and the well-calibrated baseline supports high confidence in the estimate.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 24.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude', so V4 baseline is SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13%. Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 22%, pet care 23%), suggesting a segment less digitally engaged and more likely to use cash. However, higher online rates for home appliances (55%) and holidays (65%) indicate digital adoption for larger purchases, but not for routine transactions. No qualitative evidence directly modifies this. The V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is already calibrated for this type of segment and concept, so no further adjustment is needed. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For V4, the general baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate but not majority preference for cash. Quantitative evidence from the segment shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 22%, pet care 23%), suggesting a higher-than-average cash preference compared to segments with higher online purchasing. However, for larger or less frequent purchases (home appliances 55%, holiday/travel 65%), online is more common, but these are less relevant to everyday cash use. No strong qualitative evidence is present to override the baseline. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and the well-calibrated nature of this concept in V4.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude', so V4 baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, the concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases', which V4 flags for a moderate -3pp correction due to mild over-prediction in V3. The segment (Tenant Living) shows low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 22%, pet care 23%), suggesting a higher-than-average preference for cash or in-person transactions. However, the V4 correction is already designed to account for this, and the evidence hierarchy prioritizes the quantitative data (which is directly relevant and strong). Therefore, I apply the V4 corrected template for this concept: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13%. No further demographic calibration is needed, as the segment's online behavior is already reflected in the concept-specific correction. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. V4's baseline for this is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), which is already adjusted for the general over-prediction bias found in V3. The quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 22%, pet care 23%), suggesting a segment less engaged with digital payments and more likely to use cash. However, higher online rates for home appliances (55%) and holidays (65%) indicate that for larger or less frequent purchases, digital is more accepted, but this doesn't contradict a cash preference for routine transactions. No strong qualitative evidence is provided to shift the baseline. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, with moderate confidence due to strong quantitative alignment for everyday purchases.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is classified as an attitude. The V4 baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate but not majority preference for cash. Quantitative evidence from the segment shows low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 22%, pet care 23%), suggesting a higher-than-average cash preference compared to segments with higher online purchase rates. However, for higher-ticket items (home appliances 55%, holiday/travel 65%), online purchasing is much more common, indicating that for larger or less frequent purchases, digital payments are preferred. This supports the V4 baseline, as the segment is not strongly digital-first for everyday purchases, but not overwhelmingly cash-preferring either. No demographic calibration is applied, as the evidence does not indicate a strong deviation from the general population. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and the concept being well-calibrated in V4.
