### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.76
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The concept is only labeled as 'attitude' with no further specifics, and the quantitative evidence provided is only weakly relevant (low values for behaviors like managing accounts by phone, and country of birth proportions). The rationale for defaulting to a generic attitude baseline (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is appropriate in the absence of more directly relevant or higher-relevance evidence. The repeated consistency across runs and the explicit acknowledgment of the evidence's limitations further support the estimate's validity. No revision is required unless more specific concept detail or higher-relevance evidence becomes available.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.75 / Rationale: The concept is labeled as 'attitude' with no further specifics, so the default is to classify it as a generic attitude unless more context is provided. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 17%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 7%) suggests relatively low engagement or agreement with the referenced behaviors, but these are not direct attitude measures. No evidence suggests this is a cost-consciousness, self-reliance, or expensive purchase category. Thus, the most conservative and generalizable approach is to use the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' or generic attitude baseline (30% agreement: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). The confidence is moderate because the evidence is only weakly related to the core concept, and the category assignment is based on the absence of stronger cues.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.75 / Rationale: The concept is labeled as 'attitude' with no further specifics, and the quantitative evidence provided is only weakly relevant (all values are low, e.g., 0.03–0.17, and pertain to behaviors like managing accounts by phone or country of birth, not directly to an attitude statement). In the absence of direct quantitative override, I default to the semantic category most likely for a generic attitude statement, which is 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' or 'Generic Attitude' (both baseline ~30% agreement). The distribution reflects this: 30% agreement (SA+A), 30% neutral, 40% disagreement (D+SD). Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence and generic concept labeling.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.75 / Rationale: The concept is labeled as 'attitude' with no further context, so the semantic category defaults to 'Generic Attitude' unless more detail is provided. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 17%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 7%) is low and relates to specific behaviors, not attitudes, and is only moderately relevant (relevance 0.77-0.80). No evidence suggests this is a cost-consciousness, self-reliance, or expensive purchase item. Thus, the baseline for a generic attitude is used: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. No strong demographic or contextual calibration applies. Confidence is moderate due to lack of specific concept detail and only moderately relevant evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is labeled as 'attitude' with no further specifics, so the semantic category defaults to 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' or generic attitude, both of which have similar baselines (~30% agreement). The quantitative evidence provided is about behaviors (e.g., managing/arranging accounts by phone) and country of birth, but none are directly relevant to a specific attitude or behavior, and their values are low (3-17%), suggesting low engagement or agreement for the referenced behaviors. Since the evidence is not highly relevant to the concept (relevance <0.8), the category baseline is maintained. Thus, the distribution is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is moderate-high due to the clear category fit and lack of strong contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is labeled only as 'Concept' with no further detail, but the item type is 'attitude.' In the absence of specific content, the most conservative and generalizable approach is to use the 'Generic Attitude' semantic category, which has a baseline of 35% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account by phone' at 17%, 'Arrange current account by phone' at 7%) is low and relates to behaviors, not attitudes, and is only moderately relevant (relevance <0.8). No evidence suggests a higher or lower agreement than the generic attitude baseline. Therefore, the baseline is used with no demographic calibration. Confidence is moderate-high due to the lack of specific concept detail but strong category fit.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence: very low self-identification as environmentalist (12%) and moderate skepticism toward energy companies (34%). The estimate does not exceed the semantic category baseline for 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' and is appropriately conservative given the weak environmental engagement in this segment. The distribution is sensibly tilted toward neutrality and disagreement, matching the evidence. The confidence is high due to the strong alignment between the topline data and the predicted distribution. No major qualitative or demographic evidence is omitted that would alter the topline. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (12% agreement) and 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' (34% agreement). The very low self-identification as environmentalist (12%) suggests even lower agreement than the category baseline, but the 'energy companies' item is more negative and less directly relevant. Given the evidence, I maintain the category baseline (30% agreement) but do not increase it. The rest of the distribution is set accordingly, with a slight tilt toward disagreement due to the low environmentalist self-ID. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear category fit.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). Quantitative evidence shows only 12% agree with 'I consider myself an environmentalist' and 34% agree that 'energy companies do not care about the environment'—both indicate low environmental engagement in this segment. No evidence suggests higher agreement. Demographic or qualitative hints do not indicate a more progressive or environmentally focused audience. Therefore, the baseline is maintained, with a slight lean toward the lower end due to the very low 'environmentalist' self-identification. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). The strongest quantitative evidence is 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (12% agreement) and 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' (34% agreement). The very low self-identification as environmentalist (12%) suggests even lower agreement than the category baseline, but the more general skepticism toward companies (34%) is closer to the baseline. Since the target is about what brands should do (virtue signaling, not personal action), and the evidence is weak for strong environmental attitudes in this segment, I retain the category baseline (30% agreement) and do not increase it. The distribution is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with category and quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (12% agreement) and 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' (34% agreement). The very low self-identification as environmentalist (12%) suggests even lower agreement than the category baseline, but the more general skepticism toward companies (34%) is closer to the baseline. Given these, I retain the category baseline (30% agreement) but do not increase it. No strong demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence. The distribution is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the category and supporting evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (12% agreement) and 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' (34% agreement). The very low self-identification as environmentalist (12%) strongly suggests that this segment is not highly engaged with environmental attitudes, so the baseline should not be raised. No demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence. The final estimate closely follows the category baseline, with a slight downward tilt due to the low direct evidence for environmental attitudes in this segment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence directly relevant to environmental attitudes.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for agreement with 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is well justified. The rationale consistently references the high outgoings on housing and utilities (value=134.08), which is highly relevant and supports the expectation of cost-conscious behavior among tenants. The semantic category ('Cost-Consciousness Behaviors') is appropriate, and the baseline agreement rates (~70%) are reasonable for this context. The absence of strong digital or environmental attitudes is correctly noted as not detracting from the cost-saving motivation. Demographic calibration for tenants is also appropriately considered. The repeated convergence of estimates across runs further supports the robustness of the prediction. No major gaps in evidence selection or logic are apparent. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.80%
  Slightly agree: 39.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 15.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is a classic example of a 'Cost-Consciousness Behavior' (Category 1). This category is characterized by high agreement (baseline ~70%) because saving money on utilities is a universal concern, especially for tenants and lower-income segments. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on housing and utilities (value=134.08), which further incentivizes efforts to reduce usage. There is no evidence of strong digital or environmental attitudes that would significantly alter the baseline. Demographic calibration for tenants (often lower income) may slightly increase agreement due to higher price sensitivity. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category. This category is characterized by high agreement (baseline ~70%) because saving money on utilities is a universal concern, especially for tenants with moderate means. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on housing and utilities (value=134.08), which further motivates cost-saving behaviors. No evidence suggests a lower-than-average tendency to economize on energy. Demographic calibration for tenants (often lower to middle income) supports the baseline or may slightly increase agreement. No strong evidence from digital or local business attitudes alters this pattern. Thus, the estimate closely follows the category baseline, with high confidence due to strong category fit and supporting quantitative context.
Run 3: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=38.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: This concept fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving money on utilities is a near-universal priority, especially for tenants with moderate to low incomes. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on housing and utilities (value=134.08), which further incentivizes efforts to reduce usage. No evidence suggests a lower-than-average tendency for this group to cut down on energy use. Demographic calibration for tenants (often lower income) slightly increases agreement. The final estimate is: Strongly agree 32%, Slightly agree 38%, Neither 15%, Slightly disagree 10%, Strongly disagree 5%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is a classic example of a COST-CONSCIOUSNESS BEHAVIOR. This category is characterized by high agreement (baseline ~70%) because saving money on utilities is a universal concern, especially for tenants and lower-income groups. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on housing and utilities (value=134.08), which further incentivizes efforts to reduce usage. There is no evidence of strong digital or environmental attitudes that would significantly alter this baseline. Demographic calibration (tenant/lower-income) does not reduce agreement for cost-saving behaviors. Thus, the estimate closely follows the category baseline: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=38.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: This concept falls under the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving money on utilities is a universal concern, especially for tenants with significant outgoings on housing and utilities (quantitative evidence: £134/month on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels). There is no evidence of strong environmental virtue signaling or effort aversion that would lower agreement. Demographic calibration is neutral here, as tenants are typically cost-sensitive. Quantitative evidence from similar attitudes (supporting local businesses, digital attitudes) is much lower, but these are unrelated categories. Therefore, the baseline is maintained with minor adjustment for context, resulting in 70% agreement (32% strongly agree, 38% slightly agree).

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence ('Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions', value=0.38) and correctly notes that this is a related but not identical construct to 'fuel consumption as the most important feature.' The estimate appropriately calibrates agreement levels slightly above the baseline for expensive purchases, but well below a majority, reflecting the evidence that only a minority prioritize environmental or cost-saving features above all else. The demographic context (tenant segment, likely lower income) is considered but not over-weighted, as the evidence does not indicate a strong cost-conscious override. The distribution is consistent across runs, and the confidence is high due to the strong alignment between the semantic category, the quantitative evidence, and the predicted topline. No major gaps or overextensions are present.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 6.20%
  Slightly agree: 14.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 29.80%
  Strongly disagree: 21.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, as it relates to a high-cost decision and prioritization of a specific feature. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.38), which is similar but not identical—environmental concern is typically less prioritized than cost-saving, but fuel consumption can be both a cost and environmental issue. However, the evidence suggests that only about 38% rate environmental friendliness as important, and likely fewer would rate fuel consumption as the single most important feature. The baseline for 'Expensive Purchases' is low (SA 3%, A 12%), and the evidence supports a slightly higher but still minority agreement. The distribution is thus: SA 6%, A 13%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 23%. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence. Demographic calibration is minimal as the segment is not specified as high- or low-income, and the evidence is segment-specific.
Run 2: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=21.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, as it refers to a high-cost decision and prioritization among features. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.38), which is a related but not identical priority. Fuel consumption is a practical, cost-related feature, but the question asks if it is the 'most important'—a high bar, and most buyers consider multiple factors (price, reliability, brand, etc.). The baseline for this category is low (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). The provided evidence (0.38 for environmental friendliness) is slightly higher than the baseline, but environmental friendliness is typically less prioritized than cost-saving features like fuel consumption. However, the 'most important' framing keeps agreement low, as most will not single out fuel consumption above all else. No strong demographic calibration is indicated for this segment. Therefore, the estimate is close to the baseline, with a slight upward adjustment for the related evidence, but still low overall.
Run 3: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=14.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments (category 5, ~15% agreement baseline). The concept 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' is about prioritizing a specific (cost-related) feature in a high-cost purchase context. Quantitative evidence: The closest direct evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.38, relevance=0.98), which is higher than the baseline but still low-moderate, and likely reflects a broader environmental concern rather than strict cost-saving. The segment's agreement with 'well insured for everything' is very low (0.10), reinforcing that this group does not prioritize expensive or risk-averse features. Demographically, this is a tenant segment (likely lower income), but the evidence does not suggest a strong cost-consciousness override (which would push agreement higher if the question was about 'saving money' directly). Therefore, the estimate is slightly above the baseline for expensive purchases, but still low overall. Distribution reflects a large neutral/disagree group, with only a small minority agreeing strongly.
Run 4: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments (category 5, ~15-20% agreement baseline). The statement 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' refers to a high-cost purchase and prioritization of a single (cost-related) feature, which is not universally the top priority for all buyers. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.38), which is somewhat related but not identical—environmental concern is typically lower than cost concern, but both are secondary to price, reliability, and brand for most buyers. The baseline for expensive purchase priorities is low (SA 3%, A 12%), and the evidence suggests a slightly higher but still minority agreement (38% for environmental, likely lower for fuel consumption as the single most important feature). Demographic calibration for this segment (tenants, likely lower income) would not increase agreement, as cost barriers and diverse priorities persist. Therefore, the estimate is: SA 6%, A 13%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 23%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, as it refers to a high-cost decision and prioritization of a specific feature. The closest quantitative evidence is the 0.38 agreement for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' as an important car-buying feature, which is related but not identical—environmental concern is typically lower than cost concern, but both are secondary to price, reliability, and brand for most buyers. The baseline for this category is low (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). The evidence (0.38) is higher than the baseline, but still not a majority, and is for a related but not identical feature. Given that fuel consumption is a cost-saving feature, it may be prioritized slightly more than environmental friendliness, but still not as the most important by most. Therefore, I slightly increase agreement from the baseline, but keep it under 30% total agreement. No strong demographic calibration is warranted for this segment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence alignment.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified based on the evidence provided. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative indicator ('I do not mind taking risks with my money' at 26%), which is a strong proxy for risk and debt aversion. The repeated use of the baseline for the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category is appropriate given the absence of evidence suggesting deviation from this norm. The qualitative and other quantitative evidence (community involvement, climate attitudes) are correctly identified as less directly relevant but are used to support the overall cautious/pragmatic profile. The confidence is appropriately high, and the evidence selection rationale is sound. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 12.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') falls under the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which typically sees moderate agreement (~43%) due to cultural and demographic variation. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the segment's agreement with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (0.26), indicating a relatively low risk appetite, which supports moderate debt aversion. No evidence suggests unusually high or low debt aversion for this segment. Other evidence (e.g., low community involvement, moderate likelihood to move) does not directly affect debt attitudes. Therefore, the baseline for this category is used: SA 18%, A 25%, N 25%, D 20%, SD 12%. Confidence is high due to strong relevance of the risk attitude evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~43% (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 26% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (indicating a risk-averse, debt-averse profile), and only 26% agree that 'climate change is the biggest threat to civilisation' (showing generally low agreement with strong attitudinal statements in this segment). The segment also shows very low engagement in community helping (7%), suggesting low social idealism and a more pragmatic, possibly cautious outlook. No evidence suggests a higher or lower debt aversion than the baseline, so the category baseline is used. Confidence is high due to strong relevance of the risk attitude evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA+A). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 26% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting a risk-averse, debt-averse profile), and only 26% agree that 'climate change is the biggest threat to civilisation' (showing low levels of strong attitudinal agreement in this segment). There is no evidence of unusually high debt aversion or strong financial conservatism, so the baseline is appropriate. Demographic or qualitative calibrations are not indicated due to lack of specific evidence. The distribution maintains moderate disagreement and a large neutral segment, reflecting the attitudinal split seen in the evidence. Confidence is high due to strong relevance of the risk attitude evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 26% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting most are risk-averse), and the segment shows low agreement with community-helping and climate concern, indicating a pragmatic, not idealistic, profile. No evidence suggests unusually high or low debt aversion for this segment, so the category baseline is appropriate. Demographic calibrations are not applied due to lack of specific age/income cues. Confidence is high due to strong relevance of the risk attitude evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA+A). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 26% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting risk aversion is common), and the segment shows low engagement in community and environmental attitudes, indicating a pragmatic, possibly cautious profile. No evidence suggests unusually high or low debt aversion for this segment, so the category baseline is appropriate. Demographic calibrations are not applied due to lack of specific age/income cues. Confidence is high due to strong relevance of the risk attitude evidence.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.80
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which is empirically known to elicit moderate-to-high agreement due to social desirability bias. The quantitative evidence (online savings management at 21%, privately owned cars at 57%, and high miscellaneous spending) is appropriately interpreted as indicating moderate financial engagement and confidence, but not enough to warrant a significant deviation from the category baseline. The minor downward adjustments to agreement rates are reasonable given the evidence. There is no contradictory evidence, and the logic for the estimate is clear and well-grounded in the provided data. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 23.80%

Run 1: Strongly agree=23.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees around 60% agreement due to positive self-concept and social desirability bias. The segment is 'tenant living', which may skew slightly lower than the general population due to more financial precarity, but the baseline remains robust. Quantitative evidence shows moderate online savings management (21%), suggesting some digital engagement but not universal. The high proportion of privately owned cars (57%) suggests some financial stability. No direct evidence contradicts the baseline, so the estimate is slightly below the category mean to reflect possible lower confidence among tenants, but still within the expected range for self-reliance identity statements. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=23.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=21.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') is a classic 'Self-Reliance Identity' statement. This category typically sees moderate-to-high agreement (baseline: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%) due to social desirability and positive self-concept. The segment's quantitative evidence shows moderate online financial management (21% manage savings online), suggesting some digital engagement but not universal confidence. Outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services are high (29%), which may indicate less tight control, but this is indirect. Car ownership is moderate (57% privately owned), which is neutral for this concept. No evidence suggests unusually high or low self-confidence in money management for this segment, so I apply the category baseline with a slight downward adjustment (−2pp from agreement, +1pp to neutral/disagree) to reflect only moderate digital financial engagement. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and moderate evidence relevance.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement due to positive self-concept and social desirability bias. The segment's quantitative evidence does not directly address money management self-assessment, but the relatively low online savings management (21%) and moderate car ownership (57%) suggest a mixed financial confidence profile. However, these do not strongly contradict the baseline for self-reliance identity, as the statement is about perceived competence rather than actual behavior. No strong demographic or behavioral evidence to adjust the baseline significantly. Thus, the estimate closely follows the category baseline: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is moderately high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=23.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=21.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees moderate-to-high agreement (~60%) due to social desirability and positive self-concept. The segment's quantitative evidence shows moderate online financial management (21%), suggesting some digital engagement but not universal. The car ownership rate (57%) and relatively high miscellaneous spending (29%) indicate a mix of financial responsibility and discretionary spending. No evidence suggests unusually high or low self-confidence in money management for this segment. Therefore, I use the category baseline (SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%), with a slight downward adjustment to reflect only moderate digital financial engagement and spending patterns, resulting in a total agreement of 57%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement due to social desirability and positive self-concept. The segment's quantitative evidence (e.g., only 21% manage savings accounts online, moderate car ownership, and high miscellaneous spending) does not indicate especially high financial sophistication or confidence, but does not strongly contradict the baseline either. There is no direct evidence of poor money management or high financial stress. Therefore, the baseline distribution for self-reliance identity is appropriate, with minor downward adjustment for the relatively low digital financial engagement. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the most relevant quantitative evidence ('fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', value=0.15, relevance=0.98) as an anchor for attitudes toward high-cost, risk-mitigation behaviors, which is methodologically sound. The semantic category ('Expensive Purchases/Commitments') is appropriate, and the low agreement baseline is well supported by both the quantitative data and the inferred segment characteristics (cost-sensitive, mass market, not affluent). The lack of qualitative or demographic evidence is acknowledged, and the absence of contradictory evidence is correctly noted. The minor adjustments across runs are reasonable and do not undermine the overall justification. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between the evidence and the predicted distribution.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.80%
  Slightly agree: 12.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 24.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category. This category typically has low agreement (~15%) because insurance is a significant recurring cost and not universally prioritized, especially among lower-income or cost-sensitive segments. The quantitative evidence supports this: only 15% agree that 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (a similar high-cost, risk-mitigation attitude), and other values for attention to adverts and mass market shopping suggest a pragmatic, price-sensitive audience. No evidence suggests unusually high insurance prioritization. Demographic calibration is minimal here, as the segment appears to be cost-conscious and not affluent. Thus, the baseline distribution for this category is applied: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between the semantic category and the quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=24.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') fits the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which typically sees low agreement (~15%) due to cost barriers and insurance being a non-universal priority. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.15, relevance=0.98), which is similarly about prioritizing a costly, practical feature in a major purchase—this supports the low baseline. Other evidence (adverts for cinema/soft drinks, mass market clothing) suggests a price-sensitive, mass-market segment, further indicating low appetite for expensive, comprehensive insurance. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence suggests deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the estimate is close to the category baseline: SA 4%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 24%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=24.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'It is important to be well insured for everything' involves a high-cost, comprehensive financial commitment, which is not a universal priority, especially for lower-income or cost-sensitive segments. The baseline for this category is low agreement (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). Quantitative evidence supports this: the closest relevant item, 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car,' has only 15% agreement, indicating that practical, cost-related features are prioritized over comprehensive coverage or insurance. No evidence suggests this segment is unusually risk-averse or insurance-focused. Demographic calibration is not applied due to lack of specific segment detail, but if anything, tenant/renter segments are less likely to prioritize full insurance. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between category baseline and quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=24.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'It is important to be well insured for everything' involves a high-cost, comprehensive financial commitment, which typically receives low agreement due to cost barriers and lack of universal priority. The closest quantitative anchor is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.15, relevance=0.98), which is also a high-cost, risk-averse purchase attitude and supports a low agreement baseline. No evidence suggests this segment is unusually risk-averse or affluent; mass market clothing and low advert engagement further suggest average or below-average financial engagement. Therefore, the baseline for Expensive Purchases (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%) is used with no significant demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') fits the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~15%) because comprehensive insurance is costly and not a universal priority, especially for lower-income or cost-sensitive segments. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.15, relevance=0.98), which is similarly about prioritizing a costly, risk-mitigating feature and shows very low agreement. Other evidence (adverts, mass market clothing) does not directly relate to insurance attitudes. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the baseline for this category (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%) is supported and slightly adjusted to match the quantitative evidence, resulting in a distribution of 17% agreement, 28% neutral, and 55% disagreement. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and highly relevant quantitative anchor.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently distinguishes between attitudes (the survey concept) and actual behaviors (the quantitative evidence), correctly noting the attitude-behavior gap. The topline figures for eating habits (very low vegan/vegetarian rates, high meat-eating) are highly relevant and appropriately used to argue that while strict healthy eating behaviors are rare, aspirational attitudes are more common. The use of the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category baseline is methodologically sound, and the repeated high confidence is warranted given the strong alignment between evidence and estimate. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 26.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, specifically about health-consciousness. According to the semantic category framework, health-conscious attitudes typically see moderate agreement (~38%). The quantitative evidence shows that only 1.4% are vegan, 8% vegetarian, and 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 69% eating meat. This indicates that while a minority practice strict healthy eating behaviors, the question is about attitude, not behavior. Therefore, the baseline for health-conscious attitudes (SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%) is appropriate. The quantitative evidence supports that actual behavior is less healthy, but attitudes are aspirational and higher. No strong demographic calibration is indicated by the evidence. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between category and evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows actual eating behaviors: only 1% vegan, 8% vegetarian, 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, and 69% eat meat. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, the majority do not follow restrictive or health-oriented diets. The semantic category is 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' (baseline: 12% SA, 26% A, 26% N, 22% D, 14% SD), which fits the pattern of moderate agreement due to aspirational attitudes but low actual behavior change. The quantitative evidence supports this: most people do not follow strict healthy diets, so agreement with 'Healthy Eating' as an attitude is moderate, not high. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows that only a small minority are vegan (1%) or vegetarian (8%), with the majority (69%) eating meat and 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary behaviors are not strongly aligned with strict health-focused diets. The semantic category is 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' (baseline: 12% SA, 26% A, 26% N, 22% D, 14% SD). The quantitative evidence supports a moderate level of agreement, as most people do not follow restrictive healthy diets, but some may still endorse the attitude. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence provided is about actual eating behaviors (vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, meat-eating rates). The data shows only 1% vegan, 8% vegetarian, 20% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, and 69% eat meat. This suggests that while a minority practice strict healthy eating (as defined by plant-based diets), the majority do not. However, attitudes toward healthy eating are typically higher than actual behavior due to social desirability and aspiration (attitude-behavior gap). According to the semantic category framework, 'Healthy Eating' attitudes fall under 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' (~38% agreement baseline). The quantitative evidence (low rates of plant-based diets) suggests that actual behavior is much lower, but since the question is about attitude, not behavior, the baseline is appropriate. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Therefore, the estimate is: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence about behavior and a well-established attitude-behavior gap.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence provided is about actual eating behaviors (meat-eating, vegetarianism, veganism, etc.). The high prevalence of meat-eating (69%) and low prevalence of vegan/vegetarian diets (1% and 8%) suggest that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual adoption of strict healthy eating behaviors is low. This supports the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category (~38% agreement baseline). The evidence is highly relevant (relevance >0.9), so it should be weighted heavily, confirming that most people do not strongly agree with healthy eating as a core value or behavior. Therefore, the baseline is maintained: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 2
Estimator average confidence: 0.80
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale clearly links the lower agreement with 'financial self-efficacy' and 'proactive financial behaviors' in the tenant living segment to a downward adjustment from the general baseline for 'Self-Reliance Identity.' The quantitative evidence (e.g., 35% for 'I only save for a specific purpose', 34% for 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort', and 11% for 'Plans to use other investments for retirement') is directly relevant and strongly supports the lower predicted agreement with the target concept. The distribution is appropriately spread to reflect higher neutrality and disagreement, which is consistent with the evidence. Confidence is appropriately rated as moderate-high due to the strong segment-specific data. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically has a baseline of ~60% agreement. However, the segment-specific quantitative evidence from the tenant living group shows much lower agreement with related financial attitudes: 'I only save for a specific purpose' (35%), 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' (34%), and 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (11%). These suggest this segment under-indexes on financial self-efficacy and proactive financial behaviors. Therefore, the baseline is adjusted downward by about 20-25 percentage points to reflect this lower engagement, resulting in an estimated agreement of ~35%. The distribution is spread to reflect higher neutrality and disagreement, consistent with the segment's demonstrated attitudes. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence directly relevant to the segment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically has a baseline of ~60% agreement. However, the provided quantitative evidence from the tenant living segment shows much lower agreement with related financial attitudes: 'I only save for a specific purpose' (35%), 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' (34%), and 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (11%). These suggest this segment under-indexes on financial self-efficacy and proactive financial behaviors. Therefore, the baseline is adjusted downward by about 20-25 percentage points to reflect this segment's lower engagement, resulting in an estimated agreement of ~35%. The distribution is spread to reflect higher neutrality and disagreement, with only a minority strongly agreeing. Confidence is moderate-high due to the strong relevance of the quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically has a baseline of ~60% agreement. However, the segment-specific quantitative evidence from the tenant living group shows much lower agreement with related financial attitudes: 'I only save for a specific purpose' (35%), 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' (34%), and 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (11%). These suggest this segment under-indexes on financial self-efficacy and proactive financial responsibility. Therefore, the baseline is adjusted downward by ~25pp to reflect this segment's lower engagement, resulting in an estimated agreement of ~35%. The distribution is spread to reflect higher neutrality and disagreement, with confidence moderately high due to strong segment-specific evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically has a baseline of ~60% agreement. However, the segment-specific quantitative evidence for tenant living shows much lower agreement with related financial attitudes: 'I only save for a specific purpose' (35%), 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' (34%), and 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (11%). These suggest this segment under-indexes on financial self-efficacy and proactive financial behaviors. Therefore, the baseline is adjusted downward by ~20pp to reflect this, resulting in an estimated agreement of ~35%. The distribution is spread to reflect higher neutrality and disagreement, consistent with the segment's lower engagement. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence directly relevant to the segment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically has a baseline of ~60% agreement. However, the segment-specific quantitative evidence for tenant living shows much lower agreement with related financial attitudes: 'I only save for a specific purpose' (35%), 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' (34%), and 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (11%). These suggest this segment under-indexes on financial self-efficacy and proactive financial behaviors. Therefore, the baseline is adjusted downward by ~15-20pp to reflect the segment's lower engagement, resulting in an estimated agreement of 35% (SA 13%, A 22%). This aligns with the critic feedback to moderate the estimate based on segment evidence. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category baseline, which is appropriate given the concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'). The quantitative evidence (notably high utility outgoings) is acknowledged as a potential incentive but is correctly not over-weighted, since there is no direct evidence of increased willingness to switch. The behavioral data (low engagement in optional activities) is appropriately used to support the baseline. The repeated high-confidence statements are warranted given the strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence. No major gaps or misapplications are present; the estimate is well-grounded in the provided evidence.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category is characterized by actions that require significant time or effort, which typically see low agreement due to effort aversion and inertia, even if there is a potential cost-saving. The baseline for this category is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence from the segment shows that this audience has substantial outgoings on utilities (value=2367.66), which could slightly increase perceived value of switching, but the actual behavioral data (e.g., sporting events attendance, places of worship) does not indicate a particularly proactive or engaged segment. No strong evidence suggests a major deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the baseline distribution is maintained, with high confidence due to strong category fit and lack of overriding evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category, as it involves a behavior that requires time and administrative effort (switching suppliers), rather than a simple attitude or a cost-saving action with minimal friction. The baseline for this category is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence from the segment shows that this audience does pay significant amounts for utilities (suggesting some incentive to switch), but actual behavioral data (e.g., sporting event attendance, places of worship) is low, indicating low engagement in optional activities. This supports the idea that effortful behaviors are not widely adopted. No strong demographic calibration is warranted here. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the category and supporting evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' falls under the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, while switching suppliers can save money, it requires time, research, and administrative effort—barriers that deter many people. The quantitative evidence provided does not directly measure attitudes toward switching, but the high outgoings on utilities (2367.66 per year) suggest a potential incentive to switch. However, the actual behavioral data (e.g., sporting events attendance at 19%, places of worship at 9%) indicates relatively low engagement in optional or effortful activities, supporting the baseline. No evidence suggests a higher-than-baseline agreement. Therefore, the estimate remains close to the category baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with established patterns for effortful cost-saving behaviors.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' falls under the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, while switching suppliers can save money, it requires time, research, and administrative effort—barriers that deter many people. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting a potential incentive to switch), but this does not directly translate to willingness to expend effort. The closest direct evidence (from similar populations) is not about switching behavior itself, so the category baseline (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is maintained. No strong demographic or contextual evidence justifies a major upward or downward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, while switching utilities can save money, it requires significant time and effort, and many people are inertia-bound or perceive the process as complex. The quantitative evidence does not directly measure attitudes toward switching, but the high outgoings on utilities suggest a potential incentive to switch, which could slightly increase agreement. However, the actual behavioral data (e.g., sporting events attendance, places of worship) is not directly relevant. Therefore, I use the category baseline (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) with minor upward calibration for the high utility costs, but not enough to move it out of the low-agreement range. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of overriding evidence.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is sufficiently justified based on the provided evidence. The quantitative toplines show low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks and pet care), which supports the inference that this segment is less digitally oriented for routine transactions and thus more likely to use cash. The higher online rates for home appliances and holiday/travel are correctly interpreted as reflecting digital adoption for larger, less frequent purchases, which does not contradict the cash preference for everyday spending. The qualitative evidence is limited, but the rationale acknowledges this and does not overstate its influence. The estimate remains close to the baseline for the semantic category, with only minor calibration, which is methodologically sound given the evidence. Confidence is high due to the strong alignment between the quantitative data and the estimate. No major revisions are needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 24.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The target concept ('I like to use cash when making purchases') fits the payment preference category, which has a baseline of ~37% agreement (SA+A). Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 22%, pet care 23%), suggesting this segment is less digitally oriented and more likely to use cash. However, higher online rates for home appliances (55%) and holiday/travel (65%) indicate willingness to use digital methods for larger or less frequent purchases, but not for day-to-day items. This supports the idea that cash is still preferred for routine transactions. No strong qualitative evidence is available, so the estimate relies on the quantitative pattern and the category baseline. No major demographic calibration is applied, as the segment is not specified as elderly or rural, which would otherwise increase cash preference. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of 37% agreement (13% strongly agree, 24% slightly agree). The quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 22%, pet care 23%), suggesting this segment is less digitally oriented and more likely to use cash, which supports the baseline. However, higher online rates for home appliances (55%) and holiday/travel (65%) indicate some digital adoption for larger purchases, but these are less relevant to everyday cash use. No strong qualitative evidence is present to shift the baseline. Demographic calibration is minimal, as 'tenant living' may skew slightly younger and urban, but not enough to significantly alter the baseline. Therefore, the baseline distribution is maintained, with moderate confidence due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The target concept ('I like to use cash when making purchases') fits the payment method preference category, which typically sees moderate agreement (~35-40%) due to generational and demographic splits. The quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 22%, pet care 23%), suggesting this segment is less digitally oriented and more likely to use cash. However, higher online rates for home appliances (55%) and holidays (65%) indicate some digital adoption for larger purchases, but these are less frequent. The segment is likely to skew toward cash for routine, lower-value purchases. No strong qualitative evidence is available, so the baseline is only modestly adjusted upward for this segment. Final estimate: 37% agreement (13% strongly agree, 24% slightly agree), 28% neutral, 35% disagreement (22% slightly disagree, 13% strongly disagree). Confidence is high due to strong quantitative relevance.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~37% agreement (SA 13%, A 24%). The quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 22%, pet care 23%), suggesting this segment is less digitally engaged and more likely to prefer traditional payment methods like cash. This supports the baseline or possibly a slight upward calibration, but not a dramatic increase, as online purchase of home appliances and travel is higher (55%, 65%), indicating some digital adoption for larger purchases. No strong qualitative evidence is present to override the baseline. Therefore, the baseline distribution is maintained, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The statement 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the payment preference category, which typically sees moderate agreement (baseline ~37%). The quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 22%, pet care 23%), suggesting this segment is less digitally oriented and more likely to use cash. However, for higher-ticket items (home appliances 55%, holidays 65%), online is more common, but these are infrequent purchases. The qualitative context (tenant living) likely skews toward lower income and possibly older or less digitally engaged demographics, both of which are associated with higher cash preference. Therefore, the estimate is slightly above the baseline for this category, with a modest increase in agreement and a corresponding decrease in disagreement. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
