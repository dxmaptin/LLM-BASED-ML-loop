### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.76
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The concept is labeled only as 'Concept' with no further detail, and the item type is 'attitude.' The quantitative evidence provided relates to behaviors and demographics with low prevalence and moderate relevance, but none are directly tied to the attitude concept itself. The rationale for defaulting to the 'Generic Attitude' or 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' baseline is appropriate, as there is no evidence to suggest a higher or lower level of agreement. The distribution (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is consistent with established baselines for generic attitudes in the absence of specific evidence. Confidence is moderate-high due to the lack of contradictory or more specific evidence. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The target concept is labeled only as 'Concept' with no further detail, but the item type is 'attitude' and the quantitative evidence provided relates to behaviors (e.g., managing/arranging current accounts by phone) with low agreement (values 0.03–0.15). In the absence of a specific concept, the most conservative and generalizable approach is to use the 'Generic Attitude' or, if the context hints at a specific semantic category, to adjust accordingly. Here, the evidence suggests low engagement/agreement with the referenced behaviors, which aligns with the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' or 'Effort-Required Behaviors' categories (both ~30% agreement). Given the lack of detail, I default to the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' baseline (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). The confidence is moderate due to the generic nature of the concept and the low but relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.75 / Rationale: The target concept is labeled only as 'Concept' with no further detail, but the item type is 'attitude.' In the absence of specific content, the most conservative and generalizable approach is to use the 'Generic Attitude' semantic category (baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). The provided quantitative evidence relates to country of birth and phone banking behaviors, but none are directly relevant to a specific attitude concept (all relevance <0.8, and the highest is 0.80 for country of birth, which is not concept-specific). Therefore, the baseline for a generic attitude is used. No demographic calibrations are applied due to lack of specific concept or demographic focus. Confidence is moderate due to lack of concept detail.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.75 / Rationale: The concept is labeled as 'attitude' with no further detail, so I must use the semantic category decision tree. With no evidence of cost-saving, self-reliance, debt/risk, health, or payment method, and no indication of expensive purchases or effort, this defaults to the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' or generic attitude baseline. However, the provided quantitative evidence is not directly relevant to the concept (all values are low and pertain to unrelated behaviors or demographics), so it does not override the baseline. The default for generic attitudes is 35% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%), with the remainder distributed across neutral and disagreement. No demographic calibration is warranted as the evidence is not specific to the concept. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is labeled only as 'Concept' with no further detail, but the item type is 'attitude.' No direct quantitative evidence is provided about agreement with the concept itself; the closest quantitative evidence relates to behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging current accounts by phone) and demographic splits (country of birth), all with low prevalence (values 0.02–0.15). This suggests the concept is not a high-agreement, universal behavior or identity. In the absence of more specific context, the most conservative and generalizable approach is to assign the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' or generic attitude baseline (30% agreement: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). No demographic calibration is warranted due to lack of detail. Confidence is moderate-high due to the lack of contradictory evidence and the appropriateness of the generic attitude baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is labeled only as 'Concept' with no further detail, but the item type is 'attitude'. In the absence of specific content, the most conservative and generalizable approach is to use the 'Generic Attitude' semantic category, which has a baseline of 35% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). The provided quantitative evidence relates to behaviors (e.g., managing accounts by phone) and demographics (country of birth), but none are directly relevant to a specific attitude concept, and their values are low (e.g., 0.02, 0.15), indicating low prevalence for those behaviors or characteristics. No evidence suggests a need to adjust the baseline. Therefore, the default 'Generic Attitude' pattern is applied. Confidence is moderate-high due to the lack of concept detail but strong category fit.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence: only 11% of 'prosperous professionals' consider themselves environmentalists and 30% think energy companies do not care about the environment. Both figures indicate low salience of environmental attitudes in this segment. The estimate appropriately aligns with the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category baseline, and the decision not to apply demographic calibration is well-supported by the direct evidence. The repeated high confidence is warranted given the strong alignment between the topline data and the predicted distribution. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 25% slightly disagree, and 15% strongly disagree (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows only 11% consider themselves environmentalists and 30% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating low environmental identification and skepticism. No evidence suggests higher agreement. Demographic calibration for 'prosperous professionals' (likely urban, higher income) could nudge agreement up slightly, but the direct evidence is weak, so the baseline is maintained. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events') is an environmental attitude, not a behavior. According to the V6 semantic categories, this fits 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' (Category 4), which has a baseline of 30% agreement (8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree). Quantitative evidence from the segment shows only 11% agree with 'I consider myself an environmentalist' and 30% agree that 'energy companies do not care about the environment'—both indicate low environmental attitude salience in this group. No evidence suggests higher agreement. Demographic calibration for 'prosperous professionals' (likely urban, higher income) could add +3pp, but the direct quantitative evidence is more relevant and overrides this, keeping agreement at the category baseline. Therefore, the estimate is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the very low agreement with 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (11%) and moderate agreement with 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' (30%) among 'prosperous professionals.' This suggests that even in a relatively affluent, educated segment, environmental attitudes are not strongly held. There is no evidence of higher-than-baseline environmental concern, so the baseline is appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed, as the segment is not especially urban or young. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence directly on environmental attitudes.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events') is an environmental attitude, not a behavior. According to the V6 semantic categories, this fits 'Environmental Virtue Signaling', which has a baseline of 30% agreement (8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows only 11% agree they consider themselves environmentalists and 30% agree that energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating low environmental identification and moderate skepticism. No evidence suggests higher agreement. Demographic calibration for 'prosperous professionals' (likely urban, higher income) could add +3pp, but the direct quantitative evidence is more relevant and overrides this, keeping agreement low. Therefore, the baseline is maintained. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of 30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). The quantitative evidence from this segment shows only 11% agree they consider themselves environmentalists and 30% agree that energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating low pro-environmental attitudes among 'prosperous professionals.' There is no evidence of higher-than-baseline environmental concern, so the baseline is appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed, as this affluent, urban segment might slightly increase agreement, but the direct evidence is low. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.86
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is sufficiently justified based on the evidence provided. The rationale consistently references the high baseline for cost-consciousness behaviors, which is appropriate given the universality of utility-saving motivations. The quantitative evidence (high outgoings on housing/utilities) is correctly interpreted as a potential motivator rather than a deterrent. The demographic calibration for high income is modest and well-justified, and the lack of contradictory evidence from other attitudinal measures is appropriately noted. The qualitative evidence is not directly cited, but its lower relevance (0.68) and the strong fit of the quantitative data make this acceptable. The distribution of responses is plausible and consistent across runs, with only minor variation. Overall, the justification is methodologically sound and well-grounded in the evidence.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 31.20%
  Slightly agree: 39.40%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 14.40%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving on utility bills is a universal, low-effort, money-saving behavior. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on housing/utilities (value=143.89), which may slightly increase motivation to cut down, but there is no direct evidence of lower or higher agreement than the baseline. The segment ('Prosperous Professionals') is likely high income, which can slightly increase agreement (+3pp), but this effect is modest since cost-saving is universal. No evidence suggests a significant deviation from the category baseline. Therefore, the estimate is: Strongly agree 32%, Slightly agree 39%, Neither 14%, Slightly disagree 10%, Strongly disagree 5%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving on utility bills is a universal, low-effort, and financially prudent behavior. The segment ('Prosperous Professionals') has high outgoings on housing/utilities (value=143.89), suggesting they have both the means and the incentive to care about reducing these costs. No evidence suggests unusually low or high environmental concern, so the baseline is appropriate. Demographic calibration for high income (+3pp) is applied, but since this is a cost-saving behavior (not an expensive purchase), the effect is modest. Quantitative evidence for similar 'effort to support local businesses' is much lower (13%), but that is a different semantic category (localism, not cost-saving). Thus, the estimate remains close to the cost-consciousness baseline, with a slight upward calibration for affluence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving on utility bills is a universal, low-effort, cost-saving action. The segment ('Prosperous Professionals') is likely to have high outgoings on housing/utilities (value=143.89), but this does not reduce the incentive to save—if anything, higher bills may increase motivation to cut down. No evidence suggests unusually low cost-sensitivity or environmental apathy in this group. Quantitative evidence for similar 'effort to support local businesses' is much lower (0.13), but that is a higher-effort, less universal behavior. No direct evidence contradicts the high baseline for cost-saving behaviors. Therefore, the estimate is close to the category baseline, with a slight upward calibration for higher outgoings and no demographic penalty. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of conflicting evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving on utility bills is a universal, low-effort, money-saving behavior. The segment ('Prosperous Professionals') is likely to have higher-than-average outgoings on housing and utilities (quantitative: 143.89), but this does not reduce their cost-consciousness; if anything, higher bills may increase motivation to save. No evidence suggests unusually low agreement for this group. Demographic calibration: high income (+3pp) slightly increases agreement. No strong evidence from digital or local business attitudes to adjust further. Distribution is slightly right-skewed to reflect high agreement, with a small neutral/disagree minority. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=41.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=16.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') falls under the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which typically sees high agreement (~70%) because saving money on utilities is a near-universal motivator. The segment ('Prosperous Professionals') is likely to have higher-than-average outgoings on housing and utilities (quantitative value: 143.89), but this does not reduce their cost-consciousness—if anything, higher bills may increase motivation to cut costs. No evidence suggests unusually low concern for cost or environmental issues. Demographic calibration: high income could slightly increase agreement (+3pp), but this is already reflected in the baseline. No strong evidence from digital or local business attitudes to adjust further. Final estimate: 28% strongly agree, 41% slightly agree, 16% neither, 10% slightly disagree, 5% strongly disagree. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is well justified and methodologically sound. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence ('environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' as important when buying a car: 46%), which is the closest available proxy for the target concept. The distinction between 'important' and 'most important' is clearly articulated, and the low baseline for prioritizing a single feature in expensive purchases is appropriately applied. The demographic context (affluent, urban, educated) is considered but not over-weighted, and the distribution is sensibly skewed toward disagreement and neutrality, reflecting the evidence. The confidence is high due to the strong quantitative anchor and consistent reasoning across runs. No major revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 5.80%
  Slightly agree: 13.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 27.40%
  Slightly disagree: 30.00%
  Strongly disagree: 23.60%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments (category 5, ~15% agreement baseline). The statement 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' is about prioritizing a specific (cost-related) feature in a high-cost purchase context. Quantitative evidence shows that only 46% of 'prosperous professionals' rate 'environmentally friendly/low CO2' as important when buying a car (action, relevance=0.98), and other car-related attitudes are even lower. This suggests that even among affluent, educated segments, environmental/cost efficiency is not the top priority for most. The baseline for 'Expensive Purchases' is 15% agreement, and the evidence (0.46 for a related but broader concept) justifies a modest upward adjustment, but not above 20%. Most will select other features (brand, safety, style, tech) as more important. Distribution is skewed toward disagreement, with a large neutral group. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchor.
Run 2: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=14.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments (~15% agreement baseline). The statement 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' is about prioritizing a single (cost-related) feature above all others in a high-cost purchase context. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (46%), but this is a broader environmental concern, not strictly cost/fuel. The baseline for 'Expensive Purchases' is low (SA 3%, A 12%), reflecting that few people prioritize a single feature as most important. The evidence for environmental concern is moderate (46%), but this is not directly about fuel cost, and 'well insured for everything' (11%) shows low agreement for prioritizing comprehensive features in purchases. Demographically, 'prosperous professionals' may be more likely to consider fuel economy, but not overwhelmingly so, as they can afford to prioritize other features (comfort, brand, tech). Therefore, agreement is slightly above the baseline but still low: SA 6%, A 14%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is best classified as 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' (category 5), since it refers to a high-cost decision and prioritization among features. The baseline for this category is low agreement (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). Quantitative evidence shows that only 46% of 'prosperous professionals' rate 'environmentally friendly/low CO2' as important when buying a car (relevance 0.98), which is a related but slightly broader concept. This suggests that even among affluent, educated consumers, environmental or efficiency features are not the top priority for most. Other evidence (insurance importance at 11%, pet care research at 24%) reinforces that for expensive, non-universal priorities, agreement is low. No strong demographic calibration is needed, as this segment is affluent (which would slightly increase agreement, but not enough to shift the category baseline significantly). Therefore, the estimate is close to the category baseline, with a slight upward adjustment for affluence and the 46% 'important' figure for a related feature, but still well below majority agreement.
Run 4: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is best classified as 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' (Category 5), since it refers to a high-cost decision and prioritization of a single feature (fuel consumption) over all others. The baseline for this category is low agreement (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). Quantitative evidence for a related but more progressive feature ('environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions') being important when buying a car is 0.46 (46%), but this is for a more affluent, likely more environmentally conscious segment, and is not about fuel consumption specifically, nor about it being the single most important feature. Other evidence (insurance importance 11%, pet care research 24%) supports the low baseline for prioritizing single features in expensive purchases. Demographic calibration for 'prosperous professionals' (affluent, urban) could slightly increase agreement, but not enough to override the low baseline. Therefore, the estimate remains close to the baseline, with a slight upward adjustment for this segment. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, as it refers to a high-cost decision and prioritization among features. The baseline for this category is low agreement (~15%), reflecting that few people cite a single feature as 'most important' when buying a car, especially one related to ongoing cost rather than status, safety, or brand. Quantitative evidence shows that only 46% rate 'environmentally friendly/low CO2' as important (and that's for any importance, not 'most important'), while insurance importance is even lower (11%). This suggests that even among prosperous professionals, cost-related features are not overwhelmingly prioritized as 'most important.' The distribution is therefore weighted toward disagreement and neutrality, with only a small minority strongly or slightly agreeing. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear semantic fit.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified based on the evidence provided. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative indicator ('I do not mind taking risks with my money', 27% agreement), which is directly related to financial risk and debt attitudes. The topline values for other attitudinal items in this segment are also in the same range, supporting the use of the baseline distribution for the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' category. The qualitative context (Prosperous Professionals) is appropriately considered, with the correct inference that this group is likely to be less debt-averse than average due to higher financial sophistication. No evidence contradicts the estimate, and the confidence is appropriately high given the directness and relevance of the supporting data. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 12.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' has only 27% agreement (value=0.27, relevance=0.91), indicating that this segment (Prosperous Professionals) is not especially risk-averse, but also not risk-seeking. The evidence is highly relevant and directly related to financial risk attitudes, so it is weighted at 80%. No strong demographic calibration is needed, as this segment is likely to be higher income but also more financially sophisticated, which can slightly reduce debt aversion compared to the general population. The distribution maintains the moderate agreement and higher neutrality/disagreement typical for this category and segment. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~43%. Quantitative evidence from the segment shows that only about 27% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (implying a moderate risk aversion), and other attitudes (e.g., climate change, moving) are also in the 27% range, suggesting this segment is not highly risk-averse but not risk-seeking either. There is no evidence of unusually high debt aversion or strong anti-debt sentiment in this group. Therefore, the baseline for debt/risk aversion is appropriate, and the evidence supports keeping the estimate close to the category norm. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence on risk attitudes.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' falls into the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA+A). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 27% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting a moderate to low risk appetite), and the overall agreement levels for attitudinal items in this segment are in the 27% range. There is no evidence of unusually high debt aversion or strong anti-debt sentiment in this affluent segment ('Prosperous Professionals'), who may be more comfortable with managed debt (e.g., mortgages, investments). Therefore, the baseline is appropriate, and the evidence does not justify a higher or lower estimate. No strong demographic calibration is needed, as this segment is not especially debt-averse compared to the general population. Confidence is high due to the direct quantitative evidence on risk attitudes.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 27% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting risk aversion is not dominant, but present), and the segment shows moderate agreement with other attitudinal statements (all around 27%). There is no evidence of unusually high debt aversion or risk aversion in this group ('Prosperous Professionals'), who may be more comfortable with financial tools and moderate risk. No strong demographic calibration is needed. The estimate closely follows the category baseline, with confidence boosted by the direct quantitative evidence on risk attitudes.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') falls under the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which typically sees moderate agreement (~43%) due to cultural and demographic variation. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the segment's agreement with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (0.27), indicating a relatively high risk tolerance and thus a lower-than-average aversion to debt. This suggests that this segment (Prosperous Professionals) is less debt-averse than the general population. No strong qualitative evidence contradicts this. Therefore, I use the category baseline (SA 18%, A 25%, N 25%, D 20%, SD 12%) without upward calibration, and the quantitative evidence supports not increasing agreement. Confidence is high due to strong relevance of the risk attitude evidence.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.93
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence and the reasoning provided. The segment ('Prosperous Professionals') is well-matched to the 'Self-Reliance Identity' category, which typically sees high agreement due to social desirability and positive self-concept. The quantitative evidence, while indirect, supports the inference of financial competence and confidence (e.g., high private car ownership, significant discretionary spending, and moderate online financial engagement). The +3pp calibration is reasonable and consistently applied across runs. No contradictory evidence is present, and the rationale is transparent about the limitations of the evidence. The confidence in the estimate is appropriately high given the strong category fit and supportive segment profile. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 28.00%
  Slightly agree: 36.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.00%
  Slightly disagree: 11.00%
  Strongly disagree: 7.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=11.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement due to positive self-concept and social desirability bias. The segment is 'Prosperous Professionals', who are likely to have higher financial literacy and confidence, so a +3pp demographic calibration is warranted. Quantitative evidence is indirect but supportive: high rates of private car ownership (74%) and significant discretionary spending (54.6% on miscellaneous goods/services) suggest financial comfort and management skills. 33% manage savings online, indicating engagement with financial tools. No direct quantitative override, but all evidence supports slightly above-baseline agreement. Final estimate: 64% agreement (28% SA, 36% A), 18% neutral, 18% disagreement (11% SD, 7% D). Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supportive segment profile.
Run 2: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=11.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees high agreement (baseline: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%). The segment is 'Prosperous Professionals,' a high-income, highly educated group likely to have above-average financial confidence and skills. Quantitative evidence shows high rates of private car ownership (74%) and significant spending on miscellaneous goods/services, both consistent with financial competence and self-assurance. Managing savings online (33%) suggests digital literacy and engagement with personal finance. Given the segment's profile, a modest upward calibration (+3pp to agreement) is justified. The final estimate is slightly above the baseline for this category, reflecting both the segment's affluence and the positive self-concept bias. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supportive evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=11.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees high agreement (baseline: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%). The segment is 'Prosperous Professionals,' who are likely to have higher financial literacy and confidence, justifying a slight upward calibration (+3pp to agreement). Quantitative evidence is not directly about self-assessed money management skill, but the high rate of online account management (33%) and high private car ownership (74%) suggest financial competence and engagement. No evidence contradicts the baseline, so the distribution is modestly shifted toward agreement. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and segment profile.
Run 4: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=11.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees high agreement (baseline ~60%) due to positive self-concept and social desirability bias. The segment is 'Prosperous Professionals', who are likely to have higher financial literacy and confidence, so a +3pp calibration is appropriate. Quantitative evidence is not directly about self-assessed money management skill, but the high rate of private car ownership (0.74) and significant discretionary spending (54.6% on miscellaneous goods/services) suggest financial comfort and self-assurance. The online management of savings (0.33) is moderate, but not directly relevant to self-perception. Therefore, the estimate is slightly above the baseline: Strongly agree 28%, Slightly agree 36%, Neither 18%, Slightly disagree 11%, Strongly disagree 7%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and segment profile.
Run 5: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=11.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a positive self-assessment of competence, and social desirability bias leads most people—especially higher socioeconomic groups—to rate themselves favorably. The segment 'Prosperous Professionals' is likely to have above-average financial confidence and skills, so a small upward calibration (+3pp) is warranted. Quantitative evidence is not directly about self-assessed money management, but the high rate of online account management (33%) and high private car ownership (74%) suggest financial engagement and capability, supporting the baseline. Therefore, the estimate is slightly above the category baseline, with 64% agreement (SA+A), and the rest distributed per the category pattern.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the semantic category ('Expensive Purchases/Commitments') and uses a relevant baseline. The key quantitative evidence ('fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', value=0.12, relevance=0.98) is highly analogous to the insurance attitude, supporting the low agreement estimate. The decision not to apply a demographic uplift (despite high income) is well-justified by the direct evidence of low agreement with similar attitudes. The qualitative context is acknowledged, and the evidence selection rationale is transparent. No major gaps or unwarranted assumptions are present. The confidence in the estimate is high due to strong alignment between the evidence and the predicted distribution.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 4.00%
  Slightly agree: 13.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 23.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'It is important to be well insured for everything' involves a costly, comprehensive financial commitment, which typically sees low agreement due to cost barriers and the non-universality of prioritizing insurance. The baseline for this category is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment (prosperous professionals) shows only 12% agreement with a similar high-cost, risk-averse attitude ('fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), supporting a low agreement estimate. No evidence suggests this group is unusually risk-averse or insurance-focused, so the baseline is appropriate. Demographic calibration for high income would normally add +8pp, but the direct evidence of low agreement with similar attitudes suggests not to adjust upward. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'It is important to be well insured for everything' involves a high-cost, comprehensive financial commitment, which is not a universal priority even among affluent segments. The baseline for this category is low agreement (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). Quantitative evidence from a highly relevant, similar context ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', value=0.12) supports this low baseline, indicating that even among prosperous professionals, agreement with high-cost, risk-averse attitudes is limited. No evidence suggests a need to adjust upward for this segment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and clear semantic fit.
Run 3: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'It is important to be well insured for everything' involves a high-cost, comprehensive financial commitment, which typically receives low agreement due to cost barriers and the fact that most people do not prioritize being insured for 'everything.' The baseline for this category is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment (prosperous professionals) shows only 12% agreement for a similar high-cost, risk-averse attitude ('fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), which is highly relevant (relevance=0.98) and supports the baseline. No evidence suggests a higher-than-baseline agreement. Demographic calibration: this is a high-income segment, so +8pp to agreement, but the quantitative evidence is even lower than the baseline, so the final estimate remains close to the evidence. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and clear semantic fit.
Run 4: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which typically sees low agreement (~15%) due to the cost barrier and the fact that comprehensive insurance is not a universal priority. The baseline for this category is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%. The quantitative evidence from this segment (e.g., only 12% agree that 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') supports the idea that this affluent group does not prioritize cost-avoidance or risk aversion in their attitudes, and is not especially motivated by practical or protective features. No evidence suggests a higher-than-baseline agreement. Therefore, the baseline distribution is retained, with high confidence due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments. The statement 'It is important to be well insured for everything' involves a high-cost, comprehensive financial commitment, which typically receives low agreement due to cost barriers and the fact that most people do not prioritize being 'well insured for everything.' The category baseline is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). Quantitative evidence from a highly relevant, similar context ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', value=0.12, relevance=0.98) supports this low baseline, as both involve prioritizing expensive, risk-averse features. The segment (prosperous professionals) might slightly increase agreement due to higher income, but the effect is modest (+8pp for high income in this category). However, the direct evidence (12% agreement) is highly relevant and should override the baseline, so the final estimate is closely anchored to this figure. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and clear semantic fit.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently links the quantitative evidence (very low vegan/vegetarian rates, high meat consumption) to moderate attitudinal agreement with 'Healthy Eating.' The semantic baseline for 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' is appropriately referenced, and the evidence is used to argue against inflating agreement rates. The repeated runs show stability and careful calibration, with high confidence due to the direct relevance and strength of the quantitative data. No major gaps or unjustified leaps are present; the attitudinal-behavior gap is acknowledged and handled conservatively. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.80%
  Slightly agree: 25.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.20%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 22% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, while 72% eat meat. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary choices skew toward traditional (meat-inclusive) diets, indicating a moderate rather than high agreement with healthy eating attitudes. This fits the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category (baseline: 12% SA, 26% A, 26% N, 22% D, 14% SD). The quantitative evidence (high meat consumption, low vegan/vegetarian rates) supports a moderate agreement, not a strong one. No strong demographic calibration is needed, as 'prosperous professionals' are not exceptionally health-oriented in their actual eating habits. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence provided is about actual eating behaviors (vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, meat-eating rates) among 'prosperous professionals.' The low rates of vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) diets, with 72% eating meat and 22% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, suggest that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual adoption of strict healthy-eating behaviors is low. This supports the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category (baseline ~38% agreement). However, since the evidence is about behavior (not attitude), and the group is relatively affluent (which can slightly increase health aspirations), I weight the baseline up slightly but not dramatically. The attitudinal agreement is likely higher than the strict behavioral adoption, but not by much given the evidence. Thus, I estimate: SA 13%, A 25%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is best classified under the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence for this segment (prosperous professionals) shows very low vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) rates, with a strong majority eating meat (72%) and a moderate minority pescatarian/flexitarian/other (22%). This suggests that while there may be some aspiration or positive attitude toward healthy eating, actual dietary behaviors are not strongly health-driven (i.e., not plant-based or restrictive). Therefore, the baseline is appropriate, and the evidence does not justify increasing agreement. If anything, the high meat consumption and low vegan/vegetarian rates suggest that agreement with 'Healthy Eating' as a strong value is not dominant. No major demographic calibration is needed, as prosperous professionals may be slightly more health-conscious, but the evidence does not support a large adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows that only a small minority of this segment are vegan (1.4%) or vegetarian (4.4%), with the vast majority (72%) eating meat and 22% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while there may be some aspiration toward healthy eating, actual dietary choices do not strongly reflect a health-focused or restrictive diet. The semantic category is 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' (baseline: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%), which fits the pattern of moderate agreement due to aspirational but not universal adoption. The quantitative evidence supports this moderate baseline, as the segment is not especially health-restrictive in practice. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence provided is about actual eating behaviors (vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, meat-eating) among 'prosperous professionals.' The vast majority (72%) eat meat, with only 1% vegan and 4% vegetarian, and 22% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual adoption of restrictive or health-oriented diets is low. The semantic category is 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' (baseline ~38% agreement), but the strong behavioral evidence of low adoption of healthy eating patterns among this group justifies lowering agreement slightly below baseline. The distribution reflects moderate agreement, a large neutral segment, and a notable minority who disagree, consistent with the attitudinal-behavior gap in health. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the semantic category ('Self-Reliance Identity') and its typical agreement rates, and calibrates for the 'prosperous professionals' segment based on demographic expectations. The available quantitative evidence is acknowledged as only loosely related but directionally supportive, and the lack of contradictory evidence is noted. The calibration steps are transparent and reasonable, and the final estimates are consistent with the evidence and the logic provided. No major methodological gaps are present, and confidence is high.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 26.40%
  Slightly agree: 33.60%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 19.80%
  Slightly disagree: 12.20%
  Strongly disagree: 8.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is a positive self-concept/competence statement, and social desirability bias tends to inflate agreement. The provided quantitative evidence is only loosely related: the closest is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (0.17), which is a behavior and much lower, but this is not directly about attitude toward responsibility. Other attitudes (e.g., 'I only save for a specific purpose' at 0.30, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 0.34) are not directly relevant. No evidence strongly contradicts the baseline. The segment ('prosperous professionals') is likely higher income and more self-reliant, so a small upward calibration (+3pp) is justified. Final estimate: SA 28%, A 34%, N 18%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=27.00%, Slightly agree=33.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a statement about personal responsibility and competence, which is generally viewed positively and is subject to social desirability bias, especially among higher-income, professional segments like 'prosperous professionals.' 

Quantitative evidence is limited but directionally supportive: only 17% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting most expect to rely on themselves or traditional means), and 30% only save for a specific purpose (implying a sense of personal planning). The segment's high trust in price comparison sites (54%) and moderate agreement that switching utilities is worth the effort (34%) both suggest a proactive, self-reliant financial attitude. 

Demographically, this segment is likely higher income and more educated, which slightly increases agreement with self-reliance statements (+3pp calibration). No evidence suggests a need to reduce the baseline. 

Therefore, the estimate is close to the category baseline, with a slight upward calibration for segment characteristics.
Run 3: Strongly agree=23.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a statement about personal responsibility and competence, which tends to be socially desirable, especially among higher-income, professional segments like 'prosperous professionals.' Quantitative evidence is limited but relevant: only 17% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting most see it as their own responsibility, not relying on alternatives), and related attitudes (e.g., 'I only save for a specific purpose' at 30%, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 34%) indicate moderate to high self-reliance and effort orientation. Demographically, this segment is likely to skew slightly higher on self-reliance (+3pp for high income/professional status). Therefore, I estimate agreement at 57% (23% strongly, 34% slightly), with 22% neutral, and 21% disagree (13% slightly, 8% strongly). Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=27.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=19.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a statement about personal responsibility and competence, and is subject to social desirability bias, especially among higher-income, professional segments like 'prosperous professionals.' Quantitative evidence is limited but relevant: only 17% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting a moderate sense of personal planning), and 30% only save for a specific purpose (indicating some goal-orientation but not universal). The evidence does not directly contradict the baseline, but the relatively low 'plans to use other investments' suggests that while people endorse the idea of personal responsibility, fewer act on it. Therefore, I use the category baseline (SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%) with a slight upward calibration (+2pp) for this affluent, self-reliant segment. The final estimate is: SA 27%, A 34%, N 19%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and segment alignment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=27.00%, Slightly agree=33.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a statement about personal responsibility and competence, which tends to be socially desirable and positively viewed, especially among higher-income, professional segments like 'Prosperous Professionals.' Quantitative evidence is limited but consistent: only 17% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting most expect to rely on themselves or traditional means), and 30% only save for a specific purpose (implying a degree of self-directed financial planning). No evidence contradicts the baseline. Demographic calibration: this segment is high-income and professional, so a slight upward adjustment (+3pp) is warranted. Final estimate: SA 27%, A 33%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and segment alignment.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for agreement with 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category, which is appropriate given the phrasing of the statement. The topline quantitative evidence (high outgoings on utilities) is acknowledged as a potential motivator but is correctly assessed as insufficient to override the baseline, given the lack of direct evidence about switching behavior or attitudes in this segment. The qualitative notes and demographic context are also considered, and the calibration logic is sound. No major evidence is overlooked, and the confidence in the estimate is appropriately high. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is best classified as an 'Effort-Required Behavior' (Category 7). While switching suppliers can save money (which would otherwise push it toward the high-agreement cost-consciousness category), the key phrase 'well worth the effort' signals that it requires significant time and action, which typically suppresses agreement due to effort aversion. The baseline for this category is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence about high outgoings on utilities among 'prosperous professionals' suggests they have the means and incentive to consider switching, but this is offset by the fact that higher-income, busy professionals may be less motivated to undertake time-consuming tasks for marginal savings. No direct evidence suggests unusually high or low switching rates in this segment, so the baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong semantic fit and lack of overriding evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') is an attitude about a behavior that requires significant effort and time investment, rather than a simple cost-saving action. According to the learned semantic categories, this fits 'Effort-Required Behaviors' (~30% agreement baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided is not directly about switching utilities, but does show that this segment (prosperous professionals) has high outgoings on utilities, which could slightly increase their motivation to consider switching. However, the effort barrier remains significant, and there is no direct evidence that this group is more likely to switch. Therefore, the baseline is maintained, with only a minor upward calibration for affluence (+2pp to agreement), but not enough to shift the category. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of overriding evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') fits the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. While switching suppliers can save money (cost-consciousness), the key phrase 'worth the effort' signals a significant perceived hassle or time investment, which typically suppresses agreement. The baseline for this category is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence shows this segment (Prosperous Professionals) pays substantial utility bills, which could slightly increase motivation to switch, but the effort barrier remains primary. No direct evidence suggests this group is unusually proactive about switching, so the baseline is appropriate. Demographic calibration (higher income) could add a few points, but the effort aversion dominates. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' falls under the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, while switching suppliers can save money, it requires time, research, and administrative effort—barriers that reduce actual endorsement. The quantitative evidence provided (high outgoings on utilities, but no direct evidence of high switching rates or strong positive attitudes toward switching) does not override the baseline. The segment (Prosperous Professionals) may be somewhat more proactive, but the effort barrier remains significant. No strong demographic calibration applies here. Thus, the baseline for effort-required behaviors is used: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of overriding evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') is an attitude about a behavior that requires significant time and effort, rather than being a simple cost-saving action. According to the learned semantic categories, this fits 'Effort-Required Behaviors' (Category 7), which has a baseline of 30% agreement (8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree). This is because, while switching suppliers can save money, the perceived hassle and time investment create a barrier for many, even among affluent segments like 'prosperous professionals.' The quantitative evidence does not directly address attitudes toward switching, but the high outgoings on utilities suggest the segment has the means to benefit from switching, yet this does not necessarily translate to higher agreement due to effort aversion. No strong evidence suggests a deviation from the baseline, so the standard distribution is used. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence showing high online purchase rates among 'Prosperous Professionals' across multiple categories, which is a robust indicator of digital payment preference and, by extension, a lower preference for cash. The downward adjustment from the general population baseline is methodologically sound, and the qualitative profile further supports the inference of digital adoption. The distribution is well-anchored in both the quantitative toplines and the qualitative context, with clear reasoning for each adjustment. No major gaps or misinterpretations are evident.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.20%
  Slightly agree: 21.60%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The baseline for this category is ~37% agreement (13% SA, 24% A) but this is for the general population. For 'Prosperous Professionals', the quantitative evidence shows a strong preference for online purchasing across a range of categories (e.g., 54% for home appliances, 66% for holidays, even 22-24% for pet care and alcohol). This indicates a tech-savvy, digital-first segment that is less likely to prefer cash. Therefore, I shift the distribution downward from the baseline, reducing agreement and increasing disagreement. Qualitative profile also suggests affluence and digital adoption. Final estimate: 26% agreement (8% SA, 18% A), 28% neutral, 46% disagreement (28% SD, 18% SD). Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The target concept ('I like to use cash when making purchases') fits the payment preference category, which typically sees moderate agreement (~35-40%) due to generational and technological shifts, especially among affluent, urban, and professional segments. Quantitative evidence shows that Prosperous Professionals have high online purchase rates for home appliances (54%) and holidays/travel (66%), and even for categories where online is less common (alcoholic drinks 24%, pet care 22%), cash is likely less preferred. This suggests a lower-than-baseline preference for cash in this segment. Demographically, Prosperous Professionals are likely younger, urban, and tech-savvy, further reducing cash preference. Therefore, agreement is set below the category baseline, with more respondents neutral or disagreeing. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The statement 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the payment preference category, which typically sees moderate agreement (baseline: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13%). The quantitative evidence shows that even for online-friendly, affluent segments like Prosperous Professionals, online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks: 24%, pet care: 22%) are relatively low, suggesting that in-person and potentially cash-based transactions are still common for many purchases. However, this segment is likely more digital than average, so agreement may be slightly lower than the general population, but the baseline already accounts for moderate agreement. No strong evidence to shift the baseline significantly. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The baseline for this category is ~37% agreement (13% strongly agree, 24% slightly agree). However, the quantitative evidence shows that 'Prosperous Professionals' have relatively high rates of online purchasing (e.g., 54% for home appliances, 66% for holidays/travel), and even for lower-frequency categories like alcohol and pet care, online purchase rates are above 20%. This indicates a strong preference for digital payments and online shopping, which inversely correlates with a preference for cash. Therefore, I have shifted the distribution downward from the baseline, reducing agreement and increasing disagreement. The qualitative profile of 'Prosperous Professionals' also suggests higher digital adoption and less reliance on cash. The final estimate reflects a moderate minority who still prefer cash, but a clear majority who do not, consistent with the segment's digital orientation.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The target concept ('I like to use cash when making purchases') fits the payment preference category, which typically sees moderate agreement (baseline: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13%). Quantitative evidence shows that Prosperous Professionals have high online purchase rates for home appliances (54%) and holiday/travel (66%), and even for lower-frequency categories like alcohol and pet care, online rates are 22-24%. This indicates a strong digital/online purchasing orientation, suggesting a lower-than-baseline preference for cash. Therefore, I have shifted the distribution downward: slightly lower SA/A, slightly higher D/SD. Qualitative profile of 'Prosperous Professionals' also suggests higher digital adoption. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
