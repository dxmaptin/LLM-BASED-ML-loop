### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.71
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale correctly identifies that the available quantitative toplines (relating to country of birth and banking behaviors) are not directly relevant to the specific attitude concept being measured. The qualitative notes are also generic and do not provide additional context for adjustment. Therefore, applying the V4 baseline attitude template is appropriate, and the repeated rationale across runs is consistent and methodologically sound. No demographic or concept-specific calibration is warranted based on the evidence. Confidence is moderate-high due to the strong fit of the template and absence of contradictory or more specific evidence.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline template is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about the specific attitude concept, and the retrieved toplines relate to banking behaviors and country of birth, which are not directly relevant to the attitude in question. No demographic calibrations are warranted, as the evidence does not indicate a need for adjustment. The qualitative notes are generic and do not provide additional context. Therefore, the general V4 attitude baseline is used, with moderate confidence due to lack of concept-specific data.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The target concept is classified as an 'attitude', so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction or strong demographic calibration required, as the provided quantitative evidence (e.g., country of birth, account management by phone) is not directly relevant to the attitude concept and does not indicate a need for deviation from the baseline. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the general V4 attitude template is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction required, and no demographic calibration is triggered by the provided quantitative evidence (which is about account management and country of birth, not directly relevant to the attitude concept). No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the general V4 attitude template is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated, and no demographic calibration is warranted from the provided evidence (the quantitative toplines are not directly relevant to the attitude concept, and the qualitative notes are generic). No strong evidence to shift the baseline. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence for this specific attitude in this segment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction required, and no demographic calibration is warranted as the provided quantitative evidence (e.g., 'Manage current account by phone', 'Country of Birth') is not directly relevant to the attitude concept in question. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the general V4 attitude template is applied. Confidence is moderate-high due to the lack of direct evidence but strong template fit.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 cross-class correction for systematic over-prediction, and this is well-supported by direct quantitative evidence from the segment (only 11% consider themselves environmentalists, 30% think energy companies do not care about the environment). The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the lack of qualitative evidence indicating higher environmental engagement is appropriately noted. The repeated application of the same corrected baseline across runs is justified by the strong alignment between segment data and the cross-class correction. No upward demographic adjustment is warranted, and the confidence level is appropriately high. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 23.00%
  Strongly disagree: 17.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 cross-class analysis shows this item is systematically over-predicted, so the corrected baseline is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows only 11% consider themselves environmentalists and 30% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating relatively low environmental engagement. No evidence suggests this group is more pro-environmental than the general population, so the general V4 correction applies without upward demographic adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class consistency.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 cross-class analysis shows systematic over-prediction for this concept, so the corrected baseline is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows only 11% consider themselves environmentalists and 30% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating relatively low environmental concern. No evidence suggests this segment is more pro-environment than the general population, so no upward demographic calibration is warranted. The V4 corrected baseline is therefore applied directly, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 cross-class analysis shows this item is systematically over-predicted, so the baseline is reduced to 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows only 11% consider themselves environmentalists and 30% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating relatively low environmental engagement even among 'Prosperous Professionals.' No evidence suggests this group is more pro-environment than the general population, so no upward demographic calibration is warranted. The evidence hierarchy is strong (direct quant data), so the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment data and the cross-class correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), reflecting a -15pp correction for systematic over-prediction. Quantitative evidence shows only 11% of 'Prosperous Professionals' consider themselves environmentalists, and 30% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating relatively low environmental engagement. No evidence suggests this segment is more pro-environmental than the general population. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, with no upward demographic adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class consistency of the correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), reflecting a -15pp correction due to systematic over-prediction in V3. Quantitative evidence from this segment shows only 11% consider themselves environmentalists and 30% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating relatively low environmental engagement. There is no evidence of higher-than-baseline environmental concern in this segment (Prosperous Professionals), so no upward demographic calibration is warranted. The estimate therefore uses the V4 corrected baseline for this concept type, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 protocol, which states that this item ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is well-calibrated and should retain the V3 baseline. The segment-specific evidence (Prosperous Professionals) does not provide direct quantitative or qualitative grounds for deviation from the baseline, and the toplines do not contradict the use of the general population distribution. The repeated rationales correctly note that high outgoings on utilities reflect affluence rather than a lack of effort to save energy, and that the only related attitude ('I make an effort to support local businesses') is not directly relevant. The confidence is appropriately high given the strong protocol alignment and lack of contradictory evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.00%
  Slightly agree: 40.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 15.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is classified as a low-friction behavior, but in V4 this specific item is one of the well-calibrated concepts (V3 error: -2.6pp), so the baseline should be kept unchanged: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment 'Prosperous Professionals' shows high outgoings on housing/utilities, but there is no direct evidence of unusually high or low environmental concern or energy-saving behaviors in the provided quantitative or qualitative data. No demographic calibration is needed, as this segment is not flagged for strong deviation. Therefore, the general population baseline for this item is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a low-friction behavior (easy, everyday action). According to the V4 prompt, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment 'Prosperous Professionals' is affluent and typically more environmentally aware, but V4 demographic calibrations are now reduced by 50% and the base is already high. No direct quantitative evidence for this specific item is provided, but the general attitudes and outgoings data do not contradict the baseline. Therefore, the default well-calibrated distribution is used, with high confidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is classified as a low-friction behavior/attitude, but in V4, this specific item is one of the well-calibrated concepts (V3 error: -2.6pp), so the baseline should be kept unchanged: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment 'Prosperous Professionals' is affluent and likely to be environmentally aware, but there is no direct evidence in the provided quantitative toplines to suggest a deviation from the general population for this specific behavior. The closest relevant attitude ('I make an effort to support local businesses') is low (13%), but this is not directly related to energy-saving behaviors. Therefore, the general well-calibrated baseline is most appropriate. Confidence is high due to the strong evidence base and the lack of segment-specific deviation.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is classified as a low-friction behavior/attitude, but per V4 guidance, this specific item is one of the well-calibrated concepts and should retain the V3 baseline: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. The segment 'Prosperous Professionals' is affluent and typically more engaged with pro-environmental and cost-saving behaviors, but V4 demographic calibrations are now minimal (+2pp at most), and the base rate is already high (70% agreement). No direct quantitative evidence in the retrieved subset contradicts this, and the qualitative context is not specific enough to warrant further adjustment. Therefore, the V4 template is applied without modification. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and segment fit.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ("Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home"), and for this item, V4 guidance indicates it is well-calibrated and should retain the V3 baseline: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment (Prosperous Professionals) is affluent, digitally literate, and likely to be environmentally aware, but the V4 protocol instructs not to apply additional upward demographic calibration, as the item is already well-calibrated and the segment is not one of the classes with systematic under-prediction. Quantitative evidence does not contradict this: the segment's outgoings on utilities are high (reflecting affluence, not necessarily lack of effort), and there is no evidence of strong disagreement with pro-environmental attitudes. Therefore, the standard well-calibrated distribution is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct V4 guidance and lack of conflicting evidence.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the most relevant quantitative anchor ('environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions important when buying a car' at 46%) but correctly notes that this is a broader and less restrictive framing than 'fuel consumption is the most important feature.' The V4 cross-class correction is applied appropriately, reducing agreement to 15% (SA 3%, A 12%), which is supported by systematic evidence of over-prediction in previous versions. The segment's demographic profile (Prosperous Professionals) is considered, but the evidence does not support a major upward calibration. The other available evidence (energy companies, insurance, pet care) is correctly identified as not directly relevant. The repeated application of the V4 corrected baseline, with high confidence due to strong quantitative anchoring and cross-class consistency, is methodologically sound. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 25.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude' but with a high-friction behavioral implication (prioritizing fuel consumption above all else when buying a car). V4 baseline for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3. Segment quantitative topline for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions important when buying a car' is 0.46 (46%), but this is for environmental friendliness, not specifically fuel consumption as the most important feature. Given the more restrictive wording ('most important feature'), agreement will be lower. No evidence suggests this segment (Prosperous Professionals) is much higher or lower than baseline for this item. No demographic calibration is needed. Therefore, I use the V4 corrected baseline for this concept. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence for a closely related item and strong cross-class correction evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about fuel consumption being the most important feature when buying a new car. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 46% (likely agreement), but this is a broader and somewhat more positive framing than 'fuel consumption is the most important feature', which is a more restrictive and absolute statement. V4's cross-class analysis shows that for this concept, V3 over-predicted agreement by +5pp, so the corrected baseline is 15% agreement (SA 3%, A 12%). The provided segment (Prosperous Professionals) is affluent and environmentally aware, but the evidence does not suggest a major upward calibration beyond the baseline. The other evidence (energy companies, insurance, pet care) is not directly relevant. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied with no demographic adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchoring and cross-class consistency.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the context and evidence suggest it is a high-friction behavioral proxy (since it asks for the most important feature, not just agreement). The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 46%, but this is a broader environmental concern, not specifically fuel consumption, and is not about being the single most important feature. V4's cross-class correction for this concept is to reduce agreement by -5pp from V3, due to systematic over-prediction. The corrected baseline for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The segment (Prosperous Professionals) is affluent and environmentally aware, but the evidence does not support a major upward calibration: the 46% value is for 'important', not 'most important', and the segment's insurance and other attitudes are not especially high. Therefore, I use the V4 corrected baseline for this concept, with no demographic uplift. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchoring and clear cross-class correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' V4 guidance for this concept (see 'Fuel consumption important when buying car') is to REDUCE by -5pp from V3, due to systematic over-prediction (+5.2pp error) across all classes. The corrected V4 baseline is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement).

Segment evidence: The closest quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 46%. However, this is a broader environmental concern, not specifically fuel consumption, and the V4 cross-class analysis shows that actual agreement with 'fuel consumption is the most important feature' is much lower than for general environmental attitudes. The other evidence (energy companies/environment, insurance, pet care) is less relevant.

Demographic calibration: 'Prosperous Professionals' are affluent, urban, and environmentally aware, but V4 reduces demographic calibration by 50% (now +2pp for high income). However, the systematic error for this concept is much larger than any demographic effect, so the baseline dominates.

Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied with no further upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class consistency and direct quantitative evidence showing the gap between general environmental concern and specific prioritization of fuel consumption.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the V4 prompt treats this as a high-friction behavior/priority (since 'most important' is a strong claim and car buying is a high-cost, infrequent action). The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 46%, but this is a broader environmental concern, not specifically fuel consumption, and not 'most important.' V4's cross-class analysis shows that for 'fuel consumption important when buying car,' the correct baseline is much lower (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% = 15% agreement), reflecting that few people rate it as the top priority. The segment (Prosperous Professionals) is affluent and likely to care somewhat more about environmental/fuel issues, but V4 demographic calibration for affluent classes is only +2pp, so the baseline is only slightly adjusted. The evidence hierarchy puts the 46% value as related but not directly matching the 'most important' framing, so the V4 baseline is most appropriate. The final estimate closely follows the V4 template for this concept, with a slight upward nudge for affluence, but not enough to shift the overall pattern.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale correctly identifies that there is no direct quantitative evidence on debt aversion for the 'Prosperous Professionals' segment, and the closest available quantitative items (risk-taking with money, community involvement) do not warrant a demographic calibration. The repeated use of the well-calibrated V4 baseline is appropriate, as there is no strong evidence suggesting this segment would deviate significantly from the general population on this attitude. The confidence is high due to the strong calibration of the template and the absence of contradictory evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), which is well-calibrated in V4 (no systematic error; use baseline: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%). The segment is 'Prosperous Professionals', a relatively affluent group, but there is no direct quantitative evidence on debt aversion in the provided data. The closest quantitative items (risk-taking with money, climate change attitudes, community involvement) are not directly related to debt aversion and do not justify a demographic calibration. Therefore, the general V4 attitude baseline is used. Confidence is high due to strong template calibration and lack of conflicting evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' type, so the V4 baseline is SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about debt aversion, but the segment (Prosperous Professionals) shows moderate agreement with risk-taking (27% agree), and low community helping (12%), suggesting a pragmatic, not highly risk-averse profile. However, the V4 baseline for this concept is already well-calibrated (error <1pp in all-classes analysis), so no further adjustment is needed. No demographic calibration is applied, as this segment is affluent but not extremely so, and no evidence suggests a major deviation from baseline. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' type, so the V4 baseline is SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence for debt aversion in this segment, but the provided attitudes (e.g., risk-taking with money at 27%) suggest a moderate openness to financial risk, which could slightly reduce debt aversion compared to the general population. However, the V4 template for this item is already well-calibrated and should not be adjusted unless there is strong evidence. The segment 'Prosperous Professionals' may be somewhat less debt-averse than average, but not dramatically so, especially given the moderate risk-taking score. Therefore, I retain the V4 baseline for this attitude. Confidence is high due to the well-calibrated template and lack of strong contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude statement. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the standard template: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The provided quantitative evidence (e.g., low risk-taking with money at 27%, low community helping at 12%) suggests a generally cautious and moderate profile, but does not indicate a strong deviation from the baseline. No demographic calibration is needed for 'Prosperous Professionals' as there is no evidence of systematic bias for this group on this concept. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct alignment with the well-calibrated template and lack of conflicting evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is classified as an attitude. According to the V4 prompt, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the unchanged V3 baseline: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (43% agreement). The quantitative evidence provided does not directly address debt aversion, but the segment (Prosperous Professionals) shows moderate risk tolerance (27% agree to risk-taking with money), which could slightly reduce debt aversion, but not enough to override the well-calibrated baseline. No strong qualitative evidence is present to shift the estimate. Therefore, the standard V4 distribution for this concept is applied. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and calibration guidance.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 baseline for identity statements, incorporates the concept-specific correction for 'good at managing money,' and appropriately considers the demographic calibration for the 'Prosperous Professionals' segment. The quantitative evidence (e.g., online savings management, private car ownership) supports the segment's financial competence but does not directly measure self-assessed money management skill, justifying reliance on the V4 baseline with only a minimal upward nudge. The qualitative profile is used appropriately to contextualize but not override the systematic correction. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment, concept, and calibration. No further revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 34.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity concepts is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, for this specific concept, V4 applies a moderate correction (-6pp from V3) due to systematic over-prediction, resulting in SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). The segment 'Prosperous Professionals' is affluent and likely to have higher financial confidence, but V4 demographic calibrations are now reduced by 50% (affluent: +2pp, previously +5pp). However, since the concept-specific correction is already applied and the segment is not extreme outlier, the baseline V4 distribution is appropriate. Quantitative evidence (e.g., high online savings management, high private car ownership) supports financial competence but does not justify further upward adjustment beyond the V4 correction. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment and concept type, and direct V4 calibration.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'Identity' (self-assessment of financial skill). V4 baseline for 'good at managing money' is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3 due to systematic over-prediction. Demographic: 'Prosperous Professionals' are affluent, highly educated, and likely to have above-average financial literacy and confidence. However, V4 demographic calibration for high-income is now only +2pp, so the baseline is only very slightly adjusted upwards. Quantitative evidence: 32.5% manage savings online (suggests digital literacy and engagement with finances), and high spending on miscellaneous goods/services (could indicate disposable income, not necessarily skill). No direct evidence of self-assessed money management skill, but nothing to suggest a major deviation from the V4 baseline. Therefore, the V4 baseline is used with high confidence, with only a minimal upward nudge for affluence. Evidence hierarchy: No direct quantitative data for the attitude, so baseline dominates. Confidence is high due to strong demographic fit and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is classified as an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for identity concepts is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, the concept-specific correction for 'good at managing money' is to reduce agreement by 6pp from V3, resulting in SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). For the 'Prosperous Professionals' segment, there is no strong evidence to further increase or decrease agreement: the segment is affluent and likely to have higher financial confidence, but the quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 33% manage savings online, high private car ownership) does not directly indicate a higher or lower self-assessment of money management skill. Therefore, the corrected V4 identity template for this concept is used without further demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with both the concept type and the segment's profile.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. V4 baseline for this is: SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, for this specific concept, V4 applies a moderate correction (-6pp from V3) due to systematic over-prediction, resulting in: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement). 

Demographically, 'Prosperous Professionals' are affluent, educated, and likely to have higher financial confidence. V4 demographic calibration for high income is +2pp to agreement (was +5pp in V3). This would nudge agreement up slightly, but since the concept-specific correction is already applied, and the demographic effect is modest, the final distribution remains close to the V4 template for this concept. 

Quantitative evidence (e.g., 32.5% manage savings online, high private car ownership) supports financial competence, but does not justify a major upward adjustment beyond the V4 correction. Qualitative profile also supports above-average financial self-assessment, but not to the extent of overriding the systematic correction. 

Therefore, the V4 corrected identity template is used, with a small upward nudge for affluence, resulting in the above distribution. Confidence is high due to strong evidence and well-calibrated template.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an identity statement ('I am very good at managing money'), so the V4 identity baseline is used (SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%). For 'Prosperous Professionals', there is moderate quantitative support for financial competence: 32.5% manage savings online (suggesting engagement with finances), and this group is generally affluent and likely to have higher financial literacy. However, V4 mandates a -6pp correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction in V3. Demographic calibration for affluent classes is +2pp, but this is already incorporated in the V4 correction. Therefore, the final estimate is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9%. This maintains the V4-corrected baseline for identity, with a slight upward nudge for affluence, but not exceeding the corrected ceiling. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between concept type, evidence, and calibration.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run is consistent and methodologically sound: the concept is well-calibrated in V3/V4, so the general population baseline is appropriate. The quantitative evidence from the segment (low agreement with a similar risk-averse attitude) supports not adjusting the baseline. There is no qualitative evidence suggesting deviation. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the confidence in the estimate is appropriately high. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('It is important to be well insured for everything'). According to the V4 prompt, this item is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The quantitative evidence for this segment (Prosperous Professionals) does not indicate unusually high agreement with risk-averse or insurance-focused attitudes (e.g., only 12% agree that fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car, which is a similarly practical/financially cautious attitude). There is no qualitative evidence suggesting a higher or lower baseline for insurance attitudes. Therefore, the general population baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative calibration and lack of segment-specific deviation.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this item is well-calibrated (no systematic error in V3), so the baseline template is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence for this segment (Prosperous Professionals) shows low agreement with 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.12), which is a similarly effortful, risk-averse attitude, supporting a low agreement estimate. There is no evidence in the qualitative notes to suggest a higher or lower value. No demographic calibration is needed, as this segment is not flagged for systematic bias on this concept. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class calibration.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to the V4 baseline for this concept (which is well-calibrated and should not be adjusted from V3), the expected distribution is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The provided quantitative evidence for this segment (Prosperous Professionals) does not indicate a higher-than-average concern for insurance or risk aversion; the closest relevant attitude (fuel consumption importance) is low (0.12), and there is no direct evidence of strong risk-averse or security-seeking behaviors. Therefore, the general population baseline is appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed, as this segment does not show a strong deviation from the mean on related attitudes. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and the concept being well-calibrated in V4.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is an attitude item. According to the V4 prompt, this specific concept is among those that are well-calibrated in V3 and should be left unchanged. The baseline for this item is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence from the segment (Prosperous Professionals) does not indicate a higher-than-average concern for insurance or risk aversion; the closest relevant attitude (fuel consumption importance) is low (0.12), suggesting practical, not risk-averse, priorities. No qualitative evidence suggests a deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied without demographic calibration, as this segment does not show strong deviation. Confidence is high due to direct alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the well-calibrated status of this concept.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is an attitude item. According to the V4 prompt, this concept is well-calibrated (V3 error +2.9pp), so we use the established baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence for 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.12) suggests a relatively low prioritization of practical/financial caution among 'Prosperous Professionals.' No direct evidence suggests a higher or lower insurance priority, so the general baseline is appropriate. Demographic calibration is not applied, as this segment does not show strong deviation from the general population for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and well-calibrated baseline.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes among 'Prosperous Professionals' is sufficiently justified. The topline quantitative evidence shows a strong majority (72%) are meat-eaters, with only small minorities identifying as vegan (1%), vegetarian (4%), or pescatarian/flexitarian/other (22%). This supports the rationale that, despite possible positive attitudes, actual dietary change is limited in this group. The application of the V4 -22pp correction for systematic over-prediction is well-documented and appropriate, and the resulting 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%) aligns with the evidence. No qualitative evidence contradicts this, and the demographic calibration is correctly omitted given the lack of supporting evidence for higher agreement. The rationale is consistent and confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and methodological transparency.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 26.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a -22pp correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction in all classes. Quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, 22% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, and 72% meat-eaters among 'Prosperous Professionals.' This suggests that while some may value healthy eating, actual dietary choices skew toward mainstream patterns, not strong health-motivated restriction. The attitude baseline (after correction) is SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14% (38% agreement), which fits the evidence: a moderate minority are likely to strongly agree, but most are neutral or only slightly positive. No demographic calibration is applied, as this is a high-income, well-educated group but the quantitative evidence does not support higher agreement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and the V4 cross-class correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a -22pp correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction in all classes. The provided quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 22% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 72% eating meat. This suggests that while some may value healthy eating, actual dietary choices skew toward conventional patterns, supporting a lower agreement rate. The V4 corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14% (38% agreement), which fits both the evidence and the required correction. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative support and the cross-class correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is set at 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 22% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 72% eating meat. This suggests that while some may value healthy eating, actual dietary choices skew toward conventional patterns, supporting a lower agreement rate. No strong qualitative evidence is present to override this. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, and no further demographic calibration is needed for 'Prosperous Professionals' as the evidence does not indicate a higher-than-average healthy eating attitude. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and V4's cross-class correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this item due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3 across all classes), so the baseline is set at 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). Quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, 22% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, and 72% eat meat among 'Prosperous Professionals'. This suggests that while some may value healthy eating, actual dietary change is limited, supporting the lower agreement baseline. No qualitative evidence suggests a higher or lower attitude than the general population. Therefore, the V4 corrected template is applied without further upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and cross-class consistency.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is set at 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 22% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 72% eating meat. This suggests that while some may value healthy eating, actual dietary change is limited, supporting a lower agreement estimate. No strong qualitative evidence is present to override this. The segment (Prosperous Professionals) is affluent, but V4 demographic calibration for high income is now only +2pp, which is not enough to shift the baseline. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong cross-class evidence and supporting quantitative data.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale in each run is consistent and methodologically sound: the concept is correctly identified as an attitude, and the use of the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is appropriate given the available evidence. The quantitative toplines, while not directly measuring the target attitude, are relevant and do not contradict the baseline. The demographic calibration for 'Prosperous Professionals' is correctly noted as minimal in V4, and the rationale for not applying further adjustment is well supported. The qualitative notes confirm the segment's high agency and self-reliance, aligning with the predicted high agreement. The repeated high confidence and lack of contradictory evidence further support the estimate. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.00%
  Slightly disagree: 13.00%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but closely borders on 'identity' for this affluent, self-reliant segment. V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is 25/35/18/13/9 (60% agreement), already incorporating a -3pp correction for prior over-prediction. Quantitative evidence is limited but relevant: only 17% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting most expect to self-fund or rely on pensions), and the segment shows moderate trust in financial tools (0.54) and a pragmatic approach to financial management. No evidence suggests a lower sense of personal responsibility than the baseline. Demographic calibration for 'Prosperous Professionals' (affluent, high agency) would normally add +2pp, but V4 reduces this to avoid over-prediction. Therefore, the general V4 baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong segment fit and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 attitude baseline applies: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, this concept has a moderate consistency error in V4, so the template for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). 

The quantitative evidence is only weakly related (e.g., 17% plan to use other investments for retirement, 30% only save for a specific purpose, 34% think switching utilities is worth the effort), but none directly contradicts the high agreement baseline for this concept. The segment (Prosperous Professionals) is affluent and likely to endorse personal responsibility for retirement, but V4 demographic calibrations are now much weaker (+2pp for high income). This is already reflected in the concept-specific template, so no further adjustment is needed. 

Therefore, the best estimate is to use the V4 template for this concept: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9%. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'). V4 baseline for this concept is 25% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 18% neither, 13% slightly disagree, 9% strongly disagree (60% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this affluent segment (Prosperous Professionals) shows moderate engagement with retirement planning (17% plan to use other investments for retirement), and moderate agreement with related financial attitudes (e.g., 30% only save for a specific purpose, 34% think switching utilities is worth the effort). No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the V4 baseline, as this segment is not likely to be systematically higher or lower than the general population for this attitude. Demographic calibration for affluent classes is +2pp, but V4 reduces this by 50%, so the baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with both the concept type and available quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 attitude baseline applies (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). However, this specific concept has a moderate consistency over-prediction in V3 (+3.2pp), so V4 corrects by reducing agreement by 3pp: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). 

For 'Prosperous Professionals', demographic calibration is minimal (+2pp for high income, but V4 reduces this by 50% from V3). The quantitative evidence is not directly about retirement responsibility, but the segment shows moderate engagement with financial products (e.g., 17% plan to use other investments for retirement, 30% only save for a specific purpose, 54% trust price comparison sites, 34% think switching utilities is worth the effort). These suggest a pragmatic, self-reliant financial attitude, supporting the baseline or slightly above. 

No evidence suggests a need to deviate from the V4 corrected baseline for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment profile and concept type, and the correction is based on robust cross-class error analysis.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is used: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this affluent, financially literate segment (Prosperous Professionals) does not contradict the baseline: only 17% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting most expect to self-fund or use standard pensions), and 30% only save for a specific purpose (implying some sense of personal responsibility). No evidence suggests a need to adjust the baseline up or down. Demographic calibration for affluent classes is +2pp, but V4 reduces this by 50%, so the effect is negligible and not applied here. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between concept, segment, and evidence.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently explains that the concept ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort') is well-calibrated in the V4 template, with a small historical error, and that there is no direct quantitative or qualitative evidence from the 'Prosperous Professionals' segment to warrant deviation from the baseline. The quantitative evidence provided (high outgoings on utilities, council tax) is acknowledged but correctly assessed as not directly indicative of stronger attitudes toward switching. The evidence selection rationale is transparent, and the decision to retain the baseline is methodologically sound given the evidence hierarchy. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated (V3 error: -2.1pp), so the baseline template is retained: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. The segment 'Prosperous Professionals' shows high outgoings on utilities and council tax, which could suggest a slightly higher motivation to consider switching, but there is no direct quantitative evidence of higher switching rates or stronger attitudes. The provided qualitative and quantitative evidence does not justify a deviation from the well-calibrated baseline. Therefore, the standard V4 attitude distribution is applied. Confidence is high due to the strong calibration of this item and the lack of segment-specific evidence to warrant adjustment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 baseline for this is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. This matches the V4 template for this specific concept, which is well-calibrated and does not require further adjustment. The segment (Prosperous Professionals) shows high outgoings on utilities and council tax, but there is no direct evidence of higher switching rates or stronger attitudes toward switching. The quantitative evidence is not directly related to switching behavior, so no demographic calibration is applied. Confidence is high due to the direct match with the V4 template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. This matches the V4 template for this specific concept, which is also listed as 'well-calibrated' in the V4 prompt (error <3pp, so no adjustment needed). The segment (Prosperous Professionals) shows high outgoings on utilities and council tax, which could suggest some engagement with utility management, but there is no direct evidence of higher or lower agreement with switching. No strong demographic calibration is warranted (affluent, but not a class with a large deviation for this concept). Therefore, the general V4 attitude baseline is used without adjustment. Confidence is high due to direct alignment with the V4 template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated (V3 error: -2.1pp), so the baseline template is retained: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence from the segment (high outgoings on utilities and council tax, but no direct evidence of switching behavior or strong attitudes toward switching) does not justify deviation from the baseline. The segment 'Prosperous Professionals' may be somewhat more proactive, but demographic calibration is not applied here due to the well-calibrated status and lack of direct evidence. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and template guidance.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated (V3 error: -2.1pp), so the baseline template is retained: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. The segment 'Prosperous Professionals' shows high outgoings on utilities and council tax, which could slightly increase motivation to switch, but there is no direct quantitative evidence of higher switching rates or stronger attitudes. The provided evidence (0.22 for sporting events, 0.13 for places of worship) is not directly relevant to switching utilities. Therefore, the general population baseline is appropriate, with no demographic calibration applied. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the well-calibrated status of this concept.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the quantitative toplines for online purchase behavior among Prosperous Professionals, showing moderate digital adoption that varies by category. The baseline for 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is applied without adjustment, which is appropriate given the lack of strong evidence for deviation in this segment. The confidence level is high due to the direct quantitative proxies and the well-calibrated baseline. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 24.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For Prosperous Professionals, quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 24%, pet care 22%), but higher for home appliances (54%) and holiday/travel (66%). This suggests moderate digital adoption, but not universal. V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is 13% strongly agree, 24% slightly agree, 28% neither, 22% slightly disagree, 13% strongly disagree (37% agreement). No strong evidence to shift this baseline up or down for this segment: Prosperous Professionals are digitally confident but not extreme early adopters, so the baseline is appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For Prosperous Professionals, quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 24%, pet care 22%), but much higher for home appliances (54%) and holidays/travel (66%). This suggests a mixed but overall moderate digital adoption: they are comfortable online for large or infrequent purchases, but less so for routine or low-value items, which may still be bought in person (potentially with cash). However, as an affluent, professional segment, they are likely to be above average in digital payment adoption compared to the general population. The V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is 13/24/28/22/13 (37% agreement), and there is no strong evidence to deviate from this. No demographic calibration is needed, as the segment is not especially cash-oriented nor especially digital-only. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative anchors and clear segment profile.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For Prosperous Professionals, the quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 24%, pet care 22%), but much higher for home appliances (54%) and holiday/travel (66%). This suggests a mixed digital adoption: high for big-ticket/occasional items, lower for routine purchases. However, this group is generally affluent, urban, and digitally literate, so their cash preference is likely below the national average, but not negligible. The V4 baseline for this attitude is 13% strongly agree, 24% slightly agree, 28% neither, 22% slightly disagree, 13% strongly disagree (37% agreement). No strong evidence to shift this baseline up or down for this group, as their digital adoption is context-dependent. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative anchors and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude'. V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), after correcting for V3's mild over-prediction. Quantitative evidence shows Prosperous Professionals have relatively high online purchase rates for home appliances (54%) and holiday/travel (66%), but much lower for alcohol (24%) and pet care (22%). This suggests a moderate-to-high comfort with digital payments, but not universal. No direct evidence for cash preference, but the online purchase rates (especially for high-value items) imply a lower-than-average preference for cash. However, the V4 baseline already accounts for this, and demographic calibration for this class is minimal (+2pp, but V4 reduces this by 50%, so +1pp at most, which is within rounding error). Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For V4, the general baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate but not high preference for cash. Quantitative evidence from the Prosperous Professionals segment shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 24%, pet care 22%), but much higher for home appliances (54%) and holiday/travel (66%). This suggests that while this group is comfortable with online (and likely cashless) purchases for high-value or infrequent items, they may still use cash for routine or lower-value purchases, but not at high rates. There is no strong evidence to increase or decrease the baseline for this segment, as their online adoption is context-dependent. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to the direct quantitative evidence and the well-calibrated V4 baseline for this concept.
