### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.63
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The quantitative toplines are only tangentially related to the target attitude concept and have low values, so they do not warrant deviation from the conservative attitude baseline. The qualitative notes do not provide additional context or justification for adjustment. The rationale for each run consistently applies the evidence hierarchy, using the attitude baseline template in the absence of direct evidence. Confidence is appropriately rated as moderate due to the lack of direct evidence. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative attitude baseline is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided is not directly related to the target concept (it focuses on country of birth and managing/arranging accounts by phone, all with very low values), so it does not justify a deviation from the baseline. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Demographic calibrations are not triggered due to lack of relevant context. Confidence is moderate due to the absence of direct evidence for the specific concept.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the revised baseline template is applied: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about the target concept, only about unrelated behaviors (e.g., managing/arranging accounts by phone, country of birth), all of which have very low values (1-10%). However, these are not directly relevant to the attitude concept, so they do not justify a major adjustment from baseline. No qualitative evidence is present. Following the evidence hierarchy, the attitude template is used with no further calibration. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative attitude baseline is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided is not directly related to the target concept (it focuses on country of birth and current account management by phone, both with very low values), so it does not justify deviation from the baseline. No qualitative evidence is present that would shift the distribution. No demographic calibration is warranted due to lack of relevant context. Confidence is moderate due to the absence of direct evidence for the concept.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.55 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative attitude baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided is not directly relevant to the concept (it focuses on country of birth and current account management by phone, both with very low values), so it does not justify deviation from the baseline. No qualitative evidence is present. No demographic calibration is warranted due to lack of relevant context. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' concept, so the conservative attitude baseline is used (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided is only tangentially related (e.g., country of birth, use of phone for banking), with low values (1-10%) and moderate relevance (0.76-0.80), but none directly address the target concept. There is no strong evidence to shift the baseline up or down, and no demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence. The qualitative note is empty. Therefore, the baseline attitude template is applied without adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run consistently references the most directly relevant quantitative evidence: extremely low agreement with 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (7%) and low agreement that 'energy companies do not care about the environment' (25%). These are both much lower than the conservative attitude baseline, and the predicted toplines appropriately reflect this by substantially reducing agreement and increasing disagreement. The absence of qualitative evidence is correctly noted, and the evidence hierarchy is respected by weighting the direct quantitative data most heavily. The predicted distributions are consistent across runs and are well-grounded in the provided evidence. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.80%
  Slightly agree: 11.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 31.60%
  Strongly disagree: 25.60%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=10.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=27.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability in events, for a semi-rural, mature segment. The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low agreement with 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (7%) and low agreement that 'energy companies do not care about the environment' (25%). These are both much lower than the conservative attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%). Given the direct quantitative evidence, the agreement must be pushed much lower, with strong disagreement likely to be high. No qualitative evidence is available to counter this. Therefore, the prediction is: Strongly agree 3%, Slightly agree 10%, Neither 28%, Slightly disagree 32%, Strongly disagree 27%. Confidence is high due to strong, direct quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=11.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item, but direct quantitative evidence from this segment shows extremely low agreement with environmentalist identity (7%) and low agreement that energy companies don't care about the environment (25%). This suggests a generally low salience of environmental issues for this semi-rural, mature segment. The baseline for attitude items is already conservative (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%), but the direct evidence justifies pushing agreement even lower and increasing disagreement. No qualitative evidence is available to counter the quantitative data. Therefore, the prediction is: Strongly agree 4%, Slightly agree 11%, Neither 28%, Slightly disagree 32%, Strongly disagree 25%. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability in events, for the 'semi-rural maturity' segment. The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low agreement with 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (7%) and low agreement with 'energy companies do not care about the environment' (25%). There is no evidence of strong environmental concern in this segment. The baseline for attitude items is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%, but the direct quantitative evidence (7% agreement on environmentalist identity) requires a substantial downward correction. Following the evidence hierarchy, I weight the direct quantitative data at 80%, and reduce both agreement categories by more than half. I also increase disagreement, as the segment is likely skeptical or indifferent. No qualitative evidence is available to counter this. Variance is increased to avoid regression to the mean. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=10.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=26.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item, but direct quantitative evidence shows extremely low agreement with environmentalist identity (7%) and low agreement that energy companies don't care about the environment (25%) in this semi-rural, mature segment. This indicates a strong lack of environmental concern or identification. The baseline for attitude would be SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%, but given the direct evidence, agreement must be pushed much lower and disagreement much higher. No qualitative evidence is available to contradict this. Therefore, the prediction is: Strongly agree 4%, Slightly agree 10%, Neither 28%, Slightly disagree 32%, Strongly disagree 26%. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=11.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item about environmental sustainability at events. The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low agreement with 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (7%) and low agreement that 'energy companies do not care about the environment' (25%). There is no evidence of strong environmental concern in this segment (semi-rural, mature). The baseline for attitude items is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%, but the direct evidence (7% agreement for environmentalist identity) is much lower. Following the evidence hierarchy, I weight the direct quantitative data most heavily and reduce agreement substantially below the baseline, increasing disagreement. This produces a highly skeptical distribution, with only 15% agreeing in total and 57% disagreeing. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.80
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence and the methodological guidance. The rationale consistently applies the concept-specific correction (which is based on known under-prediction for this item) and aligns it with the segment's high outgoings on utilities, which supports the plausibility of higher agreement. While direct quantitative evidence for this exact item is lacking, the use of the template is appropriate, and the segment's cost-conscious profile further supports the estimate. The repeated rationale across runs demonstrates methodological consistency and careful consideration of both quantitative and qualitative context. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 8.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-salience cost-consciousness attitude. The V2 prompt specifies a concept-specific correction for this item: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Quantitative evidence from this segment shows high outgoings on housing/utilities (73%), but low agreement with digital and local-support attitudes (all <25%), suggesting a conservative, cost-aware but not highly engaged profile. No direct quantitative data for this exact item, so the concept-specific correction is applied as the best available estimate. Confidence is high due to the direct match with the concept-specific template and supporting evidence of cost salience.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-friction behavior but, per V2 guidance, is a known under-prediction item (+21pp correction). The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', likely older, cost-conscious, and with high outgoings on utilities (73.08), suggesting strong motivation to reduce usage. Quantitative evidence for similar attitudes (supporting local businesses, digital attitudes) is low (15%, 14%), but these are not directly comparable. The concept-specific correction for this item is to INCREASE agreement: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. No direct quantitative evidence overrides this, and demographic calibration (older, cost-conscious) supports higher agreement. Confidence is high due to strong concept-specific correction and segment fit.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-salience cost-conscious behavior. The V2 prompt specifies a concept-specific correction for this item: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Quantitative evidence for this segment shows high outgoings on housing/utilities (73%), but low digital engagement and low agreement with other pro-social/attitude items (e.g., only 15% agree with 'I make an effort to support local businesses'). However, the concept-specific correction is based on observed under-prediction for this item, so the template is applied directly. No strong evidence to override the template, so the distribution is taken as specified. Confidence is high due to the direct match with the concept-specific correction and lack of contradictory quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is an attitude item. The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', with high outgoings on housing/utilities (73%), but very low agreement with digital/tech-positive statements (chatbots: 24%, computers confuse me: 14%). The direct quantitative evidence for 'make an effort to support local businesses' is also low (15%), suggesting this group is not highly proactive in certain attitudinal domains. However, the concept-specific correction for this item is to INCREASE by 21pp due to prior under-prediction, so the template is: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. There is no direct quantitative evidence for this exact item, so the concept-specific correction dominates, with minor adjustment for the segment's moderate conservatism. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit but lack of direct data.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-friction behavior but, per V2 guidance, is one of the few concepts where under-prediction is common and agreement is higher than baseline. The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', likely older, cost-conscious, and with high outgoings on utilities (73.08), which supports motivation to cut down. Quantitative evidence for similar attitude items (supporting local businesses, digital attitudes) is low (15%, 14%), but these are not directly comparable to energy-saving behaviors, which are known to be higher in this segment due to cost sensitivity. Per concept-specific correction, the template is: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. No direct quantitative override is present, so the concept-specific correction is applied as instructed. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and segment plausibility, but not maximal due to lack of direct quantitative match.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.86
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence (38% for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions important when buying a car'), which is a close proxy for the target concept. The systematic correction for over-prediction (+30pp bias) is correctly applied, and the lack of qualitative or demographic evidence to shift the estimate is appropriately noted. The repeated use of the concept-specific correction template is methodologically sound given the evidence strength and relevance. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 5.00%
  Slightly agree: 15.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 30.00%
  Strongly disagree: 22.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', but the system prompt specifies a concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' due to systematic over-prediction (+30pp bias). The provided quantitative evidence for a related environmental car-buying attitude is 38% ("environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions important when buying a car"), which is a proxy but not a direct match. This suggests moderate but not high agreement. The baseline for this concept per the prompt is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. No qualitative evidence is available to shift this further. Demographic calibration is not applied as the evidence is strong and overrides. The final prediction matches the concept-specific correction template, with high confidence due to strong quantitative proxy evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude (importance of fuel consumption when buying a car). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the 0.38 (38%) agreement for 'environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions important when buying a car' in this segment, which is a closely related but not identical concept. This suggests moderate but not majority agreement. The baseline for this concept (per system prompt) is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. This matches the evidence well, as the actual agreement is below 40%, so we should not predict higher than the template. No qualitative evidence is available to push the estimate up or down. Demographic calibration is not applied, as there is no strong evidence that this segment is more environmentally focused than average. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item, but the evidence shows low to moderate environmental concern in this segment: only 38% rate 'environmentally friendly/low CO2' as important when buying a car, and just 25% think energy companies don't care about the environment. This suggests environmental priorities are not dominant. The concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' is to reduce by 30pp due to prior over-prediction, so the template is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. No demographic uplift is warranted for this semi-rural, mature segment. Quantitative evidence is strong and directly relevant, so confidence is high.
Run 4: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item, but the evidence shows low prioritization of environmental and fuel-related car features in this segment. The closest quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 38%, but this is a broader and slightly higher-level concern than fuel consumption specifically. The segment's agreement that 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is only 12%, showing a tendency to deprioritize 'responsible' or 'prudent' features. The attitude that 'energy companies do not care about the environment' is also low (25%), suggesting environmental/fuel concerns are not top-of-mind. According to the V2 guidelines, for 'Fuel consumption important when buying car', the corrected template is SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. No evidence suggests this segment is more environmentally or cost-conscious than average, so no upward demographic calibration is applied. The prediction is therefore anchored to the concept-specific correction, with high confidence due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude item, but the evidence shows low agreement with related environmental priorities (0.38 for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' as important when buying a car) and even lower for insurance (0.12). The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', which may slightly increase practical concerns (like fuel cost), but the quantitative evidence is dominant. The concept-specific correction for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' is to reduce by 30pp from baseline, due to systematic over-prediction in this area. Therefore, I use the corrected template: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. No evidence suggests lifting agreement, and the direct data supports a low agreement estimate. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently applies the concept-specific correction template due to known over-prediction bias, and the quantitative proxies (risk-taking, community engagement, climate concern) all indicate a generally cautious but not extreme profile. There is no direct evidence on debt aversion, but the use of the validated correction template is appropriate, and the lack of demographic or attitudinal extremes in the evidence supports not applying further calibration. The confidence is high due to the systematic approach and alignment with the evidence provided.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The segment is 'ACORN semi-rural maturity', with quantitative evidence showing low agreement with risk-taking (18%), low community engagement (9%), and low concern for climate change (22%). These suggest a cautious, conservative profile, but not strongly so. The concept-specific correction for this item is to use: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (down from the original over-predicted 68% agreement). No direct quantitative evidence on debt aversion is present, so the concept-specific template is applied without further upward adjustment. Demographic calibration is not applied as the evidence does not indicate a strong deviation from the template. Confidence is high due to the strong weighting of the concept-specific correction and the lack of contradictory quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The item is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), but the V2 guidance requires a concept-specific correction due to systematic over-prediction (+26pp bias previously). The provided quantitative evidence for this semi-rural, mature segment shows low agreement with risk-taking (only 18% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money'), and very low engagement in community or climate activism (9% and 22% respectively). This suggests a cautious, conservative segment, but not one with extreme aversion to debt. The concept-specific template for this item is: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. No evidence suggests a need to deviate from this template. No demographic calibration is applied, as the segment is not strongly low-income or elderly. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative proxies and the use of a validated correction template.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The segment is 'ACORN semi-rural maturity', which typically skews older, more settled, and financially conservative, but the direct quantitative evidence provided is for unrelated attitudes (risk-taking, climate change, community help), all of which show low agreement (9-26%). There is no direct quantitative evidence for debt aversion, so the concept-specific correction for 'don't like being in debt' is applied: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. No demographic lift is applied because the evidence shows this segment is not highly likely to strongly agree with attitudinal statements in general. Confidence is high due to the strong weighting of the concept-specific correction and the consistent pattern of low agreement in the quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: This is an attitude item ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), but the V2 system prompt specifies a concept-specific correction due to systematic over-prediction (+26pp bias previously). The correct template is: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence from this segment shows low agreement with risk-taking (18% agree), low community engagement (9%), and low concern for climate change (22%), all suggesting a generally cautious and conservative profile, but not strongly so. There is no direct quantitative evidence for debt aversion, so the concept-specific correction dominates. Demographic calibration is not applied further, as the evidence does not indicate a strong deviation from the template. Confidence is high due to the direct application of the concept-specific correction and supporting low-risk attitudes in the quantitative data.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I don't like the idea of being in debt', which is an attitude item. The segment is 'ACORN semi-rural maturity', for which we have direct quantitative evidence on related attitudes: low agreement with risk-taking (0.18), low community helping (0.09), and low climate threat concern (0.22). These all indicate a generally cautious, conservative, and risk-averse profile, but not strongly so. The concept-specific correction for this item is to use: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (per prompt, due to prior over-prediction). No direct quantitative data on debt aversion is available, so the concept-specific correction is applied without further adjustment. Demographic calibration is not applied as the evidence is already conservative and the segment is not strongly low-income or high-income. Confidence is high due to strong concept-specific correction and supporting evidence of risk aversion.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.71
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently references the conservative attitude baseline and explains minor adjustments based on the segment's likely characteristics (Semi-Rural Maturity: older, stable, moderate digital engagement). The evidence used is appropriate: the proportion managing savings online, outgoings on miscellaneous goods, and low worry about car theft are all relevant, albeit indirect, indicators. The lack of direct evidence for self-assessed money management skill is acknowledged, and the adjustments to the baseline are modest and well-reasoned. The high 'neither' response is justified by likely modesty and realism in self-assessment. Overall, the approach is cautious and methodologically sound given the constraints.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 11.60%
  Slightly agree: 26.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 32.00%
  Slightly disagree: 17.40%
  Strongly disagree: 12.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an attitude item. The baseline for attitudes is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence is limited: only 31% manage savings online (suggesting moderate digital engagement), and outgoings on miscellaneous goods/services are high (41.05), which may indicate less tight money management. The segment is 'Semi-Rural Maturity', likely older, stable, and possibly more confident in their financial habits, but not necessarily highly skilled. No direct quantitative evidence on self-assessed money management skill, so I stay close to the conservative attitude baseline, nudging agreement up slightly (+2pp) for maturity/stability, but not much further due to lack of strong supporting evidence. Variance is maintained by not clustering around the mean. Confidence is moderate due to indirect evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude', so start from the conservative attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%). Quantitative evidence is limited: only 31% manage savings online (suggests moderate digital engagement), and very low worry about car theft (2%) implies financial confidence or low perceived risk. The segment is 'Semi-Rural Maturity', likely older, stable, and with high private car ownership (90%), which may indicate financial stability but not necessarily high self-rated financial skill. No direct evidence of high financial self-efficacy, so avoid over-prediction. Slightly lift agreement (+2pp each for SA/A) due to maturity/stability, but increase 'Neither' to reflect likely modesty and realism in self-assessment. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct quantitative evidence for this specific attitude.
Run 3: Strongly agree=11.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude', so the conservative baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence is limited: only 31% manage savings online (suggesting moderate digital/financial confidence), and very low worry about car theft (2%) hints at a sense of security but not necessarily financial skill. The segment is 'Semi-Rural Maturity', which typically includes older, stable, but not necessarily affluent households—likely to be prudent but not overconfident. No direct evidence of high financial self-efficacy, so I do not lift agreement. I slightly increase 'neither' (to 32%) to reflect likely modesty and conservatism in self-assessment, and slightly reduce 'disagree' and 'strongly disagree' to avoid overestimating negativity. No evidence justifies a higher agreement. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct quantitative match.
Run 4: Strongly agree=11.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an attitude item. The conservative attitude baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence is limited: only 31% manage savings online (suggesting moderate digital engagement), and outgoings on miscellaneous goods are high (41%), which could imply less tight money management, but this is not definitive. The segment (Semi-Rural Maturity) likely includes older, stable households, but there is no direct evidence of high financial confidence or skill. No strong evidence to lift or lower agreement. Therefore, I use the attitude baseline with a slight nudge upward (+1pp SA, +2pp A, +2pp N, -2pp D, -3pp SD) to reflect moderate stability but not strong financial self-efficacy. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: This is an attitude item ('I am very good at managing money'). The segment is 'Semi-Rural Maturity', which typically includes older, settled, and financially stable households, but not necessarily high-income or highly financially sophisticated. Quantitative evidence shows only 31% manage savings online (suggesting moderate digital/financial engagement), and only 2% are very worried about car theft (suggesting low anxiety, not necessarily high financial vigilance). No direct quantitative evidence about self-perceived money management skill, so the attitude baseline is used: SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the segment's likely moderate confidence and stability, I slightly lift agreement (+2pp to SA/A) and reduce disagreement (-3pp to D/SD), but not dramatically. The result is a modestly positive but not overconfident distribution, with high 'neither' due to self-assessment bias. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.91
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the most relevant quantitative evidence (low agreement with a similar high-friction, practical attitude: 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' at 15%) and correctly applies the prescribed high-friction behavior correction template due to systematic over-prediction in previous rounds. The absence of qualitative or demographic evidence to override or adjust the estimate is correctly noted. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the confidence in the estimate is appropriately high given the direct quantitative anchor and system guardrails. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything', which is a high friction behavior/attitude (requires action, cost, and planning). The most relevant quantitative evidence is for 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.15), which is a similarly high-friction, practical consideration. This low agreement (15%) signals that this segment (semi-rural, mature) is not highly motivated by practical, cost-conscious, or risk-averse attitudes. The concept-specific correction for 'well insured for everything' is to use a much lower baseline (SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%) due to systematic over-prediction in previous rounds. No qualitative evidence is available to suggest a higher or lower adjustment. Demographic calibration is not applied further, as the direct quantitative evidence is prioritized. Confidence is high due to the strong, directly relevant quantitative anchor and the established correction template.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything', which is a high-friction behavior/attitude (requires action, cost, and planning). The direct quantitative evidence for a similar high-friction attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is very low (15% agree), indicating this segment is unlikely to strongly prioritize comprehensive insurance. The V2 system prompt mandates a strong downward correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp bias previously). The prescribed template for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. No qualitative evidence is present to override this. Demographic calibration is not applied due to lack of strong segment-specific evidence. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and strong concept-specific correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything', which is subject to a specific correction due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp bias in V1). The segment is 'ACORN semi-rural maturity', but there is no evidence of unusually high insurance prioritization in the quantitative data. The closest quantitative anchor is for fuel consumption as the most important feature when buying a car (0.15), which is low and suggests a practical, cost-focused mindset rather than a strong preference for comprehensive coverage. No qualitative evidence is available to contradict this. Per system instructions, the high friction behavior template is used, with the concept-specific correction applied: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. This matches the evidence hierarchy (quantitative data dominates, no demographic lift justified). Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and strong system guardrails for this concept.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is subject to a specific correction due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp bias in v1). The correct template is the HIGH FRICTION BEHAVIOR correction: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. Quantitative evidence for this segment shows low agreement with other 'responsibility' or 'practicality' attitudes (e.g., only 15% agree fuel consumption is most important when buying a car), supporting a low agreement prediction. No qualitative evidence is available to suggest higher agreement. Demographic calibration is not applied as there is no strong evidence that this semi-rural mature segment is more insurance-focused than average. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and the concept-specific correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything' for the ACORN semi-rural maturity segment. The most relevant quantitative evidence is for a similarly practical/financial attitude ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), which is very low at 15% agreement. This suggests a strong tendency toward practical, cost-conscious, and possibly skeptical attitudes toward 'comprehensive' or 'all-in' approaches. The concept-specific correction for this item is to use the HIGH FRICTION BEHAVIOR template, further reduced by 40pp due to systematic over-prediction (+40pp bias in v1). Therefore, the distribution is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. This matches the template and is supported by the low agreement in the quantitative evidence. No demographic lift is applied, as the segment is not high-income or otherwise likely to over-index on insurance. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and a direct concept-specific correction.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes in the semi-rural, mature segment is well justified based on the provided evidence. The topline quantitative data show very low vegan and vegetarian rates and a high prevalence of meat-eating, which supports the rationale for lowering agreement with 'Healthy Eating' compared to the baseline attitude template. The runs consistently adjust agreement downward and increase neutrality and disagreement, reflecting the dietary evidence. The rationales clearly link the quantitative evidence to the attitude adjustment, and the lack of strong qualitative evidence is appropriately noted. The confidence in the estimate is high due to the direct relevance and strength of the quantitative data. No major revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 7.80%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 32.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 16.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: 1) Concept type: 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude item, so the attitude baseline applies (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%). 2) Quantitative evidence: Segment is semi-rural, mature, with very low vegan (1%), low vegetarian (4%), and high meat-eating (77%). This suggests healthy eating is not a strong identity or priority, so agreement should be LOWER than baseline. 3) Demographic calibration: No strong evidence for health-consciousness in this segment, so no positive adjustment. 4) Variance: Pushes more toward neutrality and disagreement, reflecting the quantitative data. 5) Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.86 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude), but the quantitative evidence shows extremely low rates of vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.5%) diets, with a strong majority (76.5%) eating meat and 17% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may endorse healthy eating in principle, actual dietary choices in this semi-rural, mature segment are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. The attitude template baseline (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%) is adjusted downward for agreement, given the direct evidence of low adoption of health-associated diets. Disagreement is increased, and neutrality is also raised to reflect likely ambivalence or lack of strong opinion. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative data.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). Quantitative evidence shows extremely low vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.5%) rates, with a high prevalence of meat-eating (77%) and a moderate minority (17%) in pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while a small segment may strongly agree with healthy eating, the majority are either neutral or slightly disagree, reflecting a traditional, meat-based diet typical of semi-rural, mature segments. The baseline attitude template (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%) is adjusted downward for agreement due to the low plant-based diet adoption, and disagreement is increased. No strong qualitative evidence is present, so the prediction is weighted heavily toward the quantitative data. Confidence is high due to the direct, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: 1) Concept type: 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude item, so the attitude baseline applies (SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%). 2) Quantitative evidence: Segment is overwhelmingly meat-eating (77%), with very low vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) rates, and moderate pescatarian/flexitarian/other (17%). This suggests that while some may value healthy eating, the actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. 3) Calibration: The evidence points to a more traditional, less health-restrictive eating pattern, so agreement should be LOWER than the attitude baseline. Increased 'neither' and 'disagree' to reflect this, and reduced 'agree' categories. 4) No strong qualitative evidence to override. 5) Confidence is high due to strong quantitative data.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: 1) Concept type is 'attitude', so the baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. 2) Quantitative evidence shows very low vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.5%) rates, with a high proportion eating meat (77%) and a moderate pescatarian/flexitarian/other (17%). This suggests that while some may value healthy eating, the actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with health-focused or restrictive diets. 3) No direct quantitative data on 'Healthy Eating' attitudes, but the low prevalence of plant-based diets in this segment implies lower than average agreement with strong healthy eating attitudes. 4) No strong qualitative evidence to override this. 5) Therefore, I slightly reduce agreement from the attitude baseline, increase 'neither', and slightly increase disagreement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence on actual eating habits.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The runs consistently use the most relevant quantitative evidence ('Plans to use other investments for retirement' at 14%, 'I only save for a specific purpose' at 28%, and 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 33%) to infer a relatively low sense of proactive financial responsibility in this segment. The rationale for adjusting the baseline attitude distribution is clearly explained, and the lack of strong qualitative evidence is appropriately noted. Demographic calibration is considered but not overemphasized. The confidence level is appropriate given the directness and relevance of the quantitative proxies. No major methodological gaps are present.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.80%
  Slightly agree: 27.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.40%
  Slightly disagree: 18.40%
  Strongly disagree: 13.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about personal responsibility for retirement security. The most relevant quantitative evidence is low agreement with 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (14%) and moderate agreement with 'I only save for a specific purpose' (28%). These suggest a relatively low sense of proactive financial responsibility in this segment. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low agreement in the evidence, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Demographic calibration is not strongly indicated. Confidence is moderate-high due to direct quantitative proxies.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about personal responsibility for retirement security. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (14%), which is low, suggesting little proactive behavior, and 'I only save for a specific purpose' (28%), indicating a lack of broad, self-driven saving. 'Switching utilities is worth the effort' (33%) also suggests moderate inertia. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low evidence for proactive retirement planning, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Demographic calibration is minimal for this semi-rural, mature segment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=29.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about personal responsibility for retirement security. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (14%), which is low, suggesting limited proactive planning. 'I only save for a specific purpose' (28%) also indicates a lack of broad, self-driven saving behavior. The baseline for attitude items is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low agreement in related items, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No qualitative evidence suggests a strong sense of personal responsibility. Demographic calibration is not strongly warranted for this semi-rural, mature segment. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative proxies.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about personal responsibility for retirement security. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (14%), which is low, suggesting few in this segment are proactively planning for retirement outside standard channels. Other attitudes ('I only save for a specific purpose' at 28%, 'Switching utilities worth the effort' at 33%) also show low-to-moderate proactive financial behaviors. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low evidence of proactive retirement planning, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Demographic calibration is not strongly warranted for this semi-rural, mature segment. Confidence is moderate-high due to multiple relevant quantitative items.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about personal responsibility for retirement security. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (14%), which is low, suggesting limited proactive behavior. 'I only save for a specific purpose' (28%) also indicates a lack of broad, self-driven saving. The baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. Given the low agreement in related behaviors, I slightly reduce agreement and increase neutrality/disagreement. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Demographic calibration is minimal for this segment (semi-rural, maturity), so no major adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the concept-specific correction template for high friction behaviors, which is appropriate given the absence of direct evidence for higher or lower switching motivation in this segment. The quantitative evidence (high outgoings on utilities) is acknowledged but correctly not over-interpreted as indicating a strong propensity to switch. The qualitative context is neutral, and the demographic profile (semi-rural maturity) does not warrant further adjustment. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and there is no conflicting data. Confidence is high in the justification and the resulting estimate.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as a high friction behavior. The baseline for this type is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (value=3350.77), which could suggest some cost-consciousness, but there is no direct evidence of high switching rates or strong motivation to switch. The qualitative context is neutral and does not indicate a strong culture of switching. No demographic calibration is warranted, as the segment is 'semi-rural maturity'—not especially high or low for this behavior. No evidence suggests pushing agreement higher or lower than the concept-specific correction template. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the absence of conflicting data.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as a high friction behavior. The baseline for this type is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (3350.77), but there is no direct evidence of high switching rates or strong motivation to switch. The segment (semi-rural maturity) likely has moderate inertia and may not be highly motivated to switch, aligning with the conservative baseline. No evidence suggests a need to increase agreement. No demographic calibration is applied, as the segment is not low-income or highly cost-sensitive. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the concept-specific correction and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort', which is classified as a high friction behavior. The baseline for this type is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence does not indicate unusually high or low switching activity or strong attitudes toward utilities in this segment (semi-rural, mature), and there is no direct evidence of high engagement or inertia. The outgoings data shows significant spend on utilities, but this does not imply a strong motivation to switch. No qualitative evidence suggests a deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the concept-specific correction for this item is applied as per the revised template, with no further demographic lift or reduction. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as a high friction behavior, which typically has lower agreement due to inertia and perceived hassle. The quantitative evidence does not indicate high engagement with switching or cost-saving behaviors (e.g., high outgoings on utilities, but no evidence of active switching or cost minimization). The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', which may skew slightly toward inertia and less frequent switching due to age and location, but not enough to warrant a major downward adjustment. The baseline for high friction behavior is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. No direct evidence suggests higher or lower agreement, so the concept-specific correction for this item (reduce by 15pp from v1) is applied as per the system prompt. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the absence of contradictory data.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is a high friction behavior (switching utilities), so the baseline is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows this segment (semi-rural, mature) has high outgoings on utilities (3350.77), but there is no direct evidence of high switching rates or strong motivation to switch. The qualitative notes are neutral. No evidence suggests higher or lower agreement than the baseline. Demographic calibration is not applied as there is no strong segment-specific evidence for higher/lower switching propensity. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong concept-specific template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references strong quantitative proxies (online purchase rates for everyday and higher-ticket items) that are directly relevant to the concept of cash preference. The application of a concept-specific correction (-12pp from the attitude baseline) is transparently explained and consistently applied across runs. The demographic context (Semi-Rural Maturity) is appropriately considered, and the absence of direct qualitative evidence is acknowledged. The confidence is high due to the strength and relevance of the quantitative evidence and the clear, repeatable adjustment logic. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 23.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For this segment (ACORN Semi-Rural Maturity), direct quantitative evidence for online purchase behavior is available: only 21% (alcohol), 23% (pet care), 52% (appliances), and 55% (travel) bought their last purchase online. The low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcohol, pet care) suggest a preference for traditional (offline, likely cash) transactions, but the higher rates for appliances/travel indicate some digital adoption. The concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to REDUCE by 12pp from the attitude baseline, due to higher digital adoption than attitudes suggest. Applying this template (SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%) fits the evidence: this segment is less digital than average but not strongly cash-preferring. No strong qualitative evidence overrides this. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative proxies.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases' (attitude). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the low online purchase rates for everyday categories in this segment: Alcoholic drinks (21%), Pet care (23%), Home appliances (52%), Holiday/travel (55%). The first two (everyday items) are much lower than the UK average, suggesting a preference for in-person or traditional payment methods, which may include cash. However, the concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to REDUCE by 12pp from the attitude baseline, reflecting higher digital adoption than attitudes suggest. The segment (Semi-Rural Maturity) likely skews older and more traditional, but the quantitative evidence does not show extremely low online adoption (e.g., home appliances and travel are over 50%). Therefore, I use the concept-specific template: SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and a clear concept-specific correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases' for the ACORN Semi-Rural Maturity segment. This is an attitude item, so the attitude baseline is SA 10%, A 25%, N 30%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, the provided quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 23%), suggesting a preference for traditional payment methods, possibly including cash. For higher-ticket items (home appliances 52%, holiday/travel 55%), online purchasing is more common, but these are less frequent purchases. The segment is semi-rural and mature, which typically correlates with higher cash usage than urban/younger groups, but not dramatically so. The concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' is to reduce by 12pp from the baseline, reflecting higher digital adoption than attitudes suggest. Therefore, I use the corrected template: SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and a clear segment profile.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'), but the quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 23%), and moderate for higher-ticket items (home appliances 52%, holiday/travel 55%). This suggests a segment with a relatively low digital adoption, consistent with 'Semi-Rural Maturity' (older, less urban, more traditional). However, the concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' requires reducing agreement by 12pp from the attitude baseline, reflecting higher digital adoption than attitudes suggest. Therefore, I use the corrected template: SA 12%, A 23%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 15%. The evidence is strong (direct quantitative proxies for digital behavior), so confidence is high.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'I like to use cash when making purchases' (attitude). Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 23%), with higher rates for home appliances (52%) and holidays (55%). This suggests a segment that is less digitally engaged for routine purchases, consistent with a preference for cash. However, the concept-specific correction for 'like to use cash' requires reducing agreement by 12pp from the attitude baseline, reflecting higher digital adoption than attitudes suggest. Demographic calibration for 'Semi-Rural Maturity' (likely older, less urban, moderate digital adoption) does not warrant a strong upward or downward adjustment. No direct quantitative evidence on cash preference, so the concept-specific template is applied. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong proxy evidence and clear template guidance.
