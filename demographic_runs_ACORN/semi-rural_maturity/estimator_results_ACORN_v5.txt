### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 2
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run consistently and correctly prioritizes the direct quantitative evidence (very low prevalence of managing or arranging current accounts by phone) over generic attitude baselines. The predicted agreement rates (strongly/slightly agree) are closely aligned with the observed behavioral rates (1-10%), and the majority of respondents are predicted to disagree, which is methodologically sound given the evidence. The lack of a specific attitude statement is acknowledged, and the closest relevant semantic categories are identified, but the behavioral data is rightly used as the primary anchor. The approach is transparent, evidence-based, and avoids unwarranted extrapolation. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 2.00%
  Slightly agree: 7.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.20%
  Slightly disagree: 34.00%
  Strongly disagree: 36.60%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=2.00%, Slightly agree=7.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=33.00%, Strongly disagree=40.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The only quantitative evidence provided relates to the behavior of managing or arranging current accounts by phone, with very low prevalence (1-10%). There is no clear description of the 'Concept' being predicted, but the behavioral evidence suggests that if the concept is about preference or likelihood to manage accounts by phone, agreement is extremely low. The most relevant semantic category is 'Effort-Required Behaviors' or 'Cash/Payment Preferences', but the direct quantitative evidence (1-10% prevalence) overrides the baseline, indicating that agreement is much lower than the typical 30-40% for these categories. Therefore, the estimate is calibrated to match the observed behavioral rates, with the majority of respondents disagreeing that they manage or would manage accounts by phone. Confidence is high due to the direct quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=2.00%, Slightly agree=8.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=35.00%, Strongly disagree=30.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The only quantitative evidence provided relates to behaviors (managing or arranging current accounts by phone) with very low prevalence (1-10%). There is no direct description of the 'Concept' being predicted, but the behavioral evidence suggests the relevant attitude is about willingness or preference to manage accounts by phone. According to the evidence hierarchy, direct quantitative evidence (even if behavioral) should override generic attitude baselines if relevance is high. Here, the behavioral rates are extremely low, so agreement with any related attitude is likely to be much lower than the generic 'Cash/Payment Preferences' or 'Effort-Required Behaviors' baselines. Therefore, the estimate is calibrated to reflect the low prevalence of the behavior: only a small minority would agree (strongly or slightly), with the majority disagreeing or being neutral. This approach directly integrates the quantitative evidence, as required by the critic feedback.
Run 3: Strongly agree=2.00%, Slightly agree=6.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=42.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The only quantitative evidence provided relates to behaviors (managing or arranging current accounts by phone) with very low prevalence (1-10%). There is no specific information about the attitude being predicted, but the closest relevant semantic category is 'Cash/Payment Preferences' or 'Effort-Required Behaviors'—both of which typically have low agreement, especially when the behavior is rare. Given that only about 10% manage accounts by phone and 2% arrange them by phone, agreement with any attitude supporting this behavior is likely to be very low. Therefore, the estimate is calibrated to reflect the actual behavioral prevalence, resulting in a strongly disagree-skewed distribution. This approach directly integrates the quantitative evidence, as recommended by the critic feedback, rather than defaulting to a generic attitude baseline.
Run 4: Strongly agree=2.00%, Slightly agree=7.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=35.00%, Strongly disagree=36.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The only quantitative evidence provided relates to the behavior of managing or arranging a current account by phone, with very low prevalence (2-10%). Although the item type is labeled as 'attitude', there is no further detail about the specific attitude being measured. In the absence of a clear attitude statement, the best available proxy is the behavioral evidence, which suggests that agreement with any statement about managing accounts by phone (whether as a behavior or a positive attitude) is very low. Therefore, the estimate is calibrated to reflect the low behavioral uptake: only about 9% agree (strongly or slightly), with the majority disagreeing or being neutral. This approach directly integrates the quantitative evidence, as recommended in the critic feedback, rather than defaulting to a generic attitude baseline. Confidence is high due to the direct relevance and clarity of the quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=2.00%, Slightly agree=8.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=35.00%, Strongly disagree=35.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The only available quantitative evidence relates to the behavior of managing or arranging a current account by phone, with very low prevalence (1-10%). Although the concept is only labeled as 'attitude' with no further specifics, the closest relevant semantic category is 'Cash/Payment Preferences' or 'Effort-Required Behaviors,' but the actual behavioral data (not just attitude) shows extremely low adoption. Given the lack of detail about the attitude, but strong behavioral evidence, the estimate is calibrated downward from the category baseline to reflect the real-world prevalence: most people do not manage accounts by phone, so agreement with any attitude supporting this is likely very low. The distribution is thus heavily weighted toward disagreement, with only a small minority agreeing. Confidence is high due to the direct quantitative evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is well justified and appropriately grounded in the provided evidence. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative toplines: extremely low self-identification as environmentalist (7%) and low agreement that energy companies do not care about the environment (25%), both from the same segment and with high relevance scores. The demographic calibration (semi-rural, mature) is correctly used to further justify a downward adjustment from the already-low category baseline for environmental attitudes. The predicted agreement rates (SA + A ≈ 27%) are consistently below the baseline, and the distribution across response categories is reasonable given the evidence. Confidence is high due to the direct, highly relevant quantitative evidence and the logical, transparent adjustment process. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 6.80%
  Slightly agree: 20.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 29.60%
  Slightly disagree: 25.60%
  Strongly disagree: 18.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=21.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events') is an environmental attitude, which falls under the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category (baseline: ~30% agreement). The direct quantitative evidence is highly relevant: only 7% of this segment consider themselves environmentalists, and just 25% agree that energy companies do not care about the environment—both much lower than general population averages for environmental concern. This suggests even less agreement than the already-low category baseline. Demographically, this is a semi-rural, mature segment, which typically scores lower on environmental attitudes (urban segments are higher; rural/mature are lower). Therefore, I have adjusted the baseline downward, resulting in a predicted agreement of 28% (7% strongly agree, 21% slightly agree), with a higher share in 'neither' and 'disagree' categories. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude ("brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events"), which falls under the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category. The baseline for this category is low agreement (~30%) due to the attitude-behavior gap and cost/effort concerns. Quantitative evidence from this semi-rural, mature segment shows extremely low self-identification as environmentalist (7%) and low agreement that energy companies don't care about the environment (25%), both indicating even less environmental concern than the already-low baseline. No evidence suggests higher agreement. Therefore, I further reduce agreement from the 30% baseline to about 24% (SA 6%, A 18%), with a corresponding increase in disagreement. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=21.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events') is an environmental attitude, which falls under the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category (baseline: ~30% agreement). The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low agreement with 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (7%) and low agreement with 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' (25%), both from the same segment. This suggests even lower than baseline environmental concern in this semi-rural, mature audience. Therefore, I weighted the agreement slightly below the category baseline (SA 7%, A 21%), with a higher share in neutral and disagreement. Demographic calibration (semi-rural, mature) typically further reduces environmental attitude agreement. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=20.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events') is an environmental attitude, which falls under the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category (baseline: ~30% agreement). The most relevant quantitative evidence is extremely low agreement with 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (7%) and low agreement with 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' (25%), both indicating weak pro-environmental attitudes in this segment. This evidence is highly relevant (relevance >0.9), so it overrides the category baseline and justifies a further reduction in agreement. Demographic calibration (semi-rural, mature) would not increase environmental agreement, and may slightly decrease it. Therefore, agreement is set lower than the category baseline: 7% strongly agree, 20% slightly agree, 30% neither, 25% slightly disagree, 18% strongly disagree. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=20.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept is an environmental attitude (not a behavior), specifically about brands considering sustainability at events. This fits the 'Environmental Virtue Signaling' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~30% agreement (SA 8%, A 22%). The direct quantitative evidence shows extremely low agreement with environmentalist identity (7%) and low agreement with anti-energy company sentiment (25%), both indicating that this semi-rural, mature segment is not strongly pro-environmental in attitudes. Therefore, the estimate should be at or slightly below the category baseline. Demographic calibration (semi-rural, mature) suggests even lower agreement than urban or younger segments, so the estimate is slightly below baseline. The distribution reflects a high neutral/disagree proportion, with only a small minority agreeing.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.92
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently and appropriately links the high outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels (73.08) to a high likelihood of cost-conscious behaviors, specifically efforts to cut down on utility use. The semantic category ('Cost-Consciousness Behaviors') is well-chosen, and the baseline agreement rates are reasonable and clearly explained. Demographic adjustments for 'semi-rural maturity' are modest and justified, avoiding over-adjustment. The lack of strong digital or environmental attitudes is correctly noted as not detracting from the universal appeal of cost-saving on utilities. The repeated use of highly relevant quantitative evidence and the absence of contradictory qualitative evidence further strengthen the justification. No major methodological flaws are present, and the confidence in the estimate is warranted.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 32.00%
  Slightly agree: 39.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 14.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving on utility bills is a universal, low-effort, money-saving behavior. The quantitative evidence shows that this segment spends heavily on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels (73.08), indicating high salience of these costs and thus likely motivation to reduce them. There is no evidence of digital or environmental attitudes overriding this cost-consciousness. Demographically, 'semi-rural maturity' may skew slightly older, which would increase cost-consciousness by +4pp. The final distribution is slightly above the category baseline, with 71% agreement (32% strongly, 39% slightly), reflecting both the universal appeal and the segment's high exposure to these costs. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: This concept fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category: making an effort to cut down on gas/electricity is a universal, low-effort, money-saving behavior. The quantitative evidence shows that spending on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels is high (73%), indicating that these are salient expenses and likely targets for cost-saving efforts. There is no evidence of strong digital engagement or progressive attitudes (low agreement with chat bots, computers), but this does not diminish the universal appeal of saving on utilities. Demographic calibration: the segment is 'semi-rural maturity,' likely older and possibly more cost-conscious (+4pp for cost-consciousness for elderly). Therefore, the estimate is slightly above the category baseline (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%), adjusted to SA 32%, A 39%, N 14%, D 10%, SD 5%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') is a classic example of the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category. This category is characterized by high agreement (baseline ~70%) because saving money on unavoidable household expenses is a universal motivator, especially in segments with high outgoings on utilities (supported by the quantitative evidence: 73% of outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, etc.). There is no evidence of strong digital or environmental attitudes that would significantly shift the baseline. Demographically, this is a semi-rural, mature segment, which typically shows slightly higher cost-consciousness (+4pp for age, +3pp for rural, but capped at +5pp total to avoid over-adjustment). The final estimate is slightly above the baseline: Strongly agree 32%, Slightly agree 39%, Neither 14%, Slightly disagree 10%, Strongly disagree 5%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative support and clear semantic fit.
Run 4: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.93 / Rationale: The target concept ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home') fits the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, which has a high baseline agreement (~70%) because saving money on utilities is a universal, low-effort behavior. The quantitative evidence shows that this segment spends heavily on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels (73.08), indicating high salience of these costs and likely motivation to reduce them. There is no evidence of digital or environmental attitudes that would lower agreement, and the segment is semi-rural/mature, which typically increases cost-consciousness (elderly calibration: +4pp). The distribution is slightly right-skewed to reflect strong agreement, with a small neutral/disagree minority. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=32.00%, Slightly agree=39.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=14.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.93 / Rationale: This concept falls under the 'Cost-Consciousness Behaviors' semantic category, as cutting down on gas/electricity is a universal, low-effort, money-saving action. The baseline for this category is high (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%). The quantitative evidence shows that outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels are very high (73%), indicating strong salience and likely motivation to reduce these costs. The segment is 'semi-rural maturity,' which may slightly increase cost-consciousness due to fixed incomes and higher utility costs, but the effect is marginal (+1pp to agreement). No evidence suggests a lower-than-baseline tendency. Therefore, the estimate is very close to the category baseline, with a slight nudge upward for segment context. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting quantitative evidence.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently anchors the prediction in the most relevant quantitative evidence ('Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions', value=0.38, relevance=0.98), which is the closest available proxy for prioritizing fuel consumption. The semantic mapping to the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' category is appropriate, and the baseline for this category is clearly stated and used as a reference point. The adjustment for the semi-rural, mature demographic is reasonable and conservative, reflecting only a slight nudge in agreement. The repeated emphasis that 'fuel consumption as the most important feature' is a high bar is methodologically sound, and the evidence from other related attitudes (insurance, pet care research) supports the overall pattern of low single-feature prioritization. The confidence is high due to the strong relevance and clear application of the evidence. No major gaps or unjustified leaps are present.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 5.60%
  Slightly agree: 13.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 27.60%
  Slightly disagree: 30.80%
  Strongly disagree: 22.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, as it refers to a high-cost decision and prioritization among features. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.38), which is a related but not identical concept—environmental concern is typically less prioritized than cost-saving, but both are secondary to price, reliability, and brand for most buyers. The baseline for 'Expensive Purchases' is low agreement (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). The evidence (0.38) is higher than the baseline, but still indicates minority agreement. No strong demographic calibration is needed for this semi-rural, mature segment. The final estimate is slightly above baseline for agreement, but still shows that most do not consider fuel consumption the single most important feature, with a large portion disagreeing or neutral. Confidence is high due to strong relevance of the quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, as it refers to a high-cost decision and prioritization among features. The closest quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.38), which is a related but not identical concept—environmental concern is typically less prioritized than cost-saving, but both are secondary to price, reliability, and brand for most buyers. The baseline for 'Expensive Purchases' is low agreement (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%). The evidence (0.38 for environmental friendliness) is higher than the baseline, but still not a majority, and fuel consumption is often important but rarely the single most important feature. The semi-rural, mature segment may care somewhat more about running costs, but not dramatically so. Therefore, I slightly increase agreement from baseline, but maintain a large neutral/disagree block. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and clear category fit.
Run 3: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=14.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car') is an 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' category item, as it refers to a high-cost decision and prioritization among features. The closest quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.38), which is higher than the baseline for this category (15% agreement), but still low. Fuel consumption is a cost-conscious feature, but the phrase 'most important' sets a high bar, and in practice, consumers often prioritize price, reliability, or brand over fuel economy. The evidence for environmental concern is moderate (0.38), but insurance (another expensive commitment) is even lower (0.12). Demographically, semi-rural mature audiences may care about running costs, but are not especially environmentally driven. Therefore, I estimate agreement at slightly above the baseline for expensive purchases, but still low: SA 6%, A 14%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors and clear semantic fit.
Run 4: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: Semantic category: Expensive Purchases/Commitments (~15% agreement). The statement 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' is about prioritizing a single, cost-related feature (fuel economy) above all others in a major purchase decision. This fits the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' category, which typically sees low agreement because car buyers weigh multiple factors (price, reliability, brand, style, etc.), and few will say fuel consumption is the single most important. 

Key evidence: The closest quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.38, relevance=0.98), which is higher than the baseline for expensive purchases but still only 38% agreement for a broader, more socially desirable environmental feature. Fuel consumption is related but more narrowly cost-focused and less likely to be the top priority for most buyers. Other evidence (insurance importance 0.12, pet care research 0.22) supports the pattern that single-feature prioritization in expensive purchases is rare. 

Demographic calibration: The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', likely older and more practical, which could slightly increase agreement for cost-related features (+3pp), but not enough to shift the category baseline substantially. 

Final estimate: Weighted toward the expensive purchase baseline (15%), but nudged up slightly due to the higher environmental feature anchor (38%) and the segment's likely cost-consciousness. Most will disagree or be neutral, with a minority agreeing.
Run 5: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=21.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' fits the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) because it requires prioritizing a single, cost-related feature over others in a high-cost context. The closest quantitative evidence is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 0.38, but this is a broader environmental concern, not strictly cost/fuel. The baseline for 'Expensive Purchases' is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%. The evidence (0.38) is higher than baseline, but not directly about fuel consumption; environmental priorities are typically lower than cost-saving ones in this segment. No evidence suggests a dramatic increase in agreement for fuel consumption as the single most important feature. Demographic calibration: semi-rural, mature segment may be slightly more cost-conscious, but not enough to shift the baseline significantly. Therefore, the estimate remains close to the baseline, with a slight nudge up in 'slightly agree' due to the moderate environmental concern evidence.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified based on the evidence provided. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative anchor ('I do not mind taking risks with my money' = 0.1764), which directly supports the inference of risk and debt aversion. The demographic context (semi-rural, mature) is appropriately considered as a moderating factor, but not over-weighted in the absence of direct evidence for unusually high debt aversion. The topline percentages are consistent across runs and align with the baseline for the semantic category, with minor demographic calibration. The confidence is high due to the directness and relevance of the quantitative evidence, and the absence of contradictory qualitative data. No corrective feedback is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.40%
  Slightly agree: 24.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 24.60%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 12.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~43% (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 18% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting risk aversion is common), and the segment is semi-rural/mature, which typically skews more conservative and debt-averse. No evidence suggests unusually high or low debt aversion, so the baseline is appropriate. Other evidence (low community engagement, moderate climate concern, low likelihood to move) does not directly affect debt attitudes. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant quantitative anchor.
Run 2: Strongly agree=20.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=23.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline agreement of ~43%. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (0.18), which is low, indicating a generally risk-averse segment. This supports a moderate-to-high agreement with debt aversion. The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', likely older and more conservative, which typically increases risk and debt aversion slightly. However, the baseline is already moderate, and the evidence does not suggest a very strong aversion (not >50% agreement). Therefore, the estimate is: Strongly agree 20%, Slightly agree 24%, Neither 23%, Slightly disagree 20%, Strongly disagree 13%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 17.6% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting risk aversion), and the segment is 'semi-rural maturity' (likely older, more conservative, possibly more debt-averse). No evidence suggests unusually high or low debt aversion, so the category baseline is appropriate. Demographic calibration for maturity/older age could add +2pp to agreement, but the evidence is not strong enough to warrant a larger adjustment. The final estimate closely follows the category baseline, with moderate confidence due to direct quantitative support for risk aversion.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA 18%, A 25%). This is supported by the quantitative evidence: only 17.6% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money' (suggesting risk aversion), but this is not directly about debt, so it only moderately reinforces the baseline. The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', which typically skews older and more conservative, but the evidence does not show strong anti-debt sentiment (no direct evidence of high debt aversion). Therefore, the baseline is maintained, with no major demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to category fit and supporting evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') fits the 'Debt/Risk Aversion' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~43% agreement (SA+A). The quantitative evidence for this semi-rural, mature segment shows low risk appetite (only 18% agree with 'I do not mind taking risks with my money'), which supports a moderate-to-high aversion to debt. There is no evidence of unusually high debt aversion (e.g., no strong qualitative statements about debt being taboo), but the segment is not especially risk-seeking. Demographic calibration: maturity and semi-rural location may slightly increase risk aversion, but not dramatically. Therefore, I use the category baseline with a slight tilt toward agreement, but not enough evidence to push it above 50%. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence on risk attitudes.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I am very good at managing money' is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently applies the 'Self-Reliance Identity' baseline, which is appropriate for this type of positive self-assessment statement. The demographic context (Semi-Rural Maturity) is well-integrated, with appropriate minor upward calibration based on high private car ownership and moderate online savings management, both of which suggest financial stability and self-reliance. The absence of direct evidence on self-assessed money management is acknowledged, and the use of related quantitative indicators is methodologically sound. The qualitative context is also considered. The confidence is high due to the strong fit between the evidence and the estimate. No major revisions are needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 26.20%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 19.60%
  Slightly disagree: 11.60%
  Strongly disagree: 7.60%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I am very good at managing money') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement due to positive self-concept and social desirability bias. The segment (ACORN Semi-Rural Maturity) is likely older, stable, and has high rates of private car ownership (89.6%), suggesting financial stability and self-management. No direct quantitative evidence on self-assessed money management is present, but the context (stable, mature, semi-rural) supports the baseline. No evidence suggests a need for major upward or downward calibration. Therefore, the baseline for Self-Reliance Identity is applied: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supportive qualitative context.
Run 2: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=11.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees high agreement (baseline ~60%) due to social desirability and positive self-concept. The segment is 'Semi-Rural Maturity,' which tends to skew older and more self-reliant, so a slight upward calibration is warranted (+3pp agreement). Quantitative evidence is not directly about self-assessed money management skill, but the high rate of private car ownership (0.90) and moderate online savings management (0.31) suggest financial stability and engagement, supporting the baseline. No evidence suggests a lower-than-average self-assessment. Distribution is slightly right-skewed to reflect social desirability bias and the mature, self-reliant segment. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and demographic alignment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees about 60% agreement due to positive self-concept and social desirability bias. The segment is 'ACORN Semi-Rural Maturity,' a group likely to have stable finances and higher self-confidence in money management, but not necessarily exceptional. Quantitative evidence is not directly about self-assessed money management skill, but the high rate of private car ownership (0.90) and moderate online savings management (0.31) suggest financial stability and some engagement with financial tools. No evidence suggests unusually high or low self-confidence in this area, so the baseline is appropriate. Demographic calibration for this mature, semi-rural group would slightly increase self-reliance (+3pp), but not enough to shift the category baseline significantly. Thus, the estimate remains close to the category baseline: 60% agreement (25% strongly, 35% slightly), 20% neutral, 20% disagreement (12% slightly, 8% strongly).
Run 4: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=11.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' fits the Self-Reliance Identity category (baseline ~60% agreement: SA 25%, A 35%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%). This is a positive self-concept statement, which tends to be inflated by social desirability bias. The segment is 'Semi-Rural Maturity', which typically includes older, stable, and self-sufficient households. Quantitative evidence shows high rates of private car ownership (90%) and moderate online savings management (31%), both suggesting financial competence and self-reliance. There is no evidence of financial distress or risk aversion that would lower self-assessment. Demographically, semi-rural and mature segments tend to rate themselves higher on self-reliance (+3pp calibration). Therefore, I slightly increase agreement from the baseline. The final estimate is: Strongly agree 28%, Slightly agree 36%, Neither 18%, Slightly disagree 11%, Strongly disagree 7%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supportive evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees around 60% agreement (SA+A). This is due to positive self-concept and social desirability bias, especially in mature, semi-rural populations who may pride themselves on financial competence. The quantitative evidence is not directly about self-assessed money management skill, but does show moderate online savings management (31%) and very high private car ownership (90%), suggesting financial stability and self-reliance. No evidence contradicts the baseline, and the segment (Semi-Rural Maturity) likely skews slightly higher on self-reliance due to age and rural factors (+3pp calibration). Therefore, the baseline distribution is used with a slight upward calibration for this audience. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supportive qualitative context.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.87
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently anchors the prediction to the most relevant quantitative evidence ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', value=0.15, relevance=0.98), which is a strong and directly analogous indicator for attitudes toward expensive, risk-mitigation purchases. The semantic category ('Expensive Purchases/Commitments') is correctly identified as having a low baseline agreement, and the demographic context ('semi-rural maturity') is appropriately considered but not over-weighted due to lack of strong evidence for higher risk aversion or affluence. The distribution is reasonable and well-aligned with both the quantitative anchor and the expected category baseline. Confidence is high due to the clear, repeated alignment with the strongest available evidence and the absence of contradictory data. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 4.00%
  Slightly agree: 13.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 23.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which typically has low agreement (~15%) due to the high cost and non-universality of comprehensive insurance. The closest quantitative anchor is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.15, relevance=0.98), which is also a high-cost, risk-averse attitude and supports the low baseline. No evidence suggests this segment is unusually risk-averse or affluent, so no demographic calibration is applied. The distribution is centered on low agreement, with a majority disagreeing or neutral, matching both the category baseline and the quantitative anchor. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') fits the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) due to the cost barrier and lack of universal priority. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.15, relevance=0.98), which is a similarly high-cost, risk-mitigation attitude and shows only 15% agreement. This directly supports the baseline. The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', which may slightly increase risk aversion, but not enough to shift the baseline significantly. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the distribution is anchored at the category baseline, with a slight nudge toward the quantitative evidence (SA 4%, A 13%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 23%). Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which typically sees low agreement (~15%) due to the high cost and non-universality of comprehensive insurance. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the high-relevance topline for 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.15, relevance=0.98), which is directly analogous: both are about prioritizing expensive, risk-mitigating features when making major purchases. This supports the baseline. No evidence suggests higher agreement. Demographic calibration for 'semi-rural maturity' (likely older, more risk-averse, but also cost-conscious) could nudge agreement up slightly, but not enough to shift the category. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%. Rounded up slightly for possible age/risk aversion, but not more than 2pp. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and clear semantic fit.
Run 4: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') fits the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which typically sees low agreement (~15%) due to the cost barrier and the fact that comprehensive insurance is not a universal priority. The closest quantitative anchor is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.15, relevance=0.98), which is also a high-cost, risk-mitigation attitude and supports the baseline. No evidence suggests this segment is unusually risk-averse or affluent. Therefore, the baseline (SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%) is used with minimal adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and clear semantic fit.
Run 5: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=23.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') falls under the 'Expensive Purchases/Commitments' semantic category, which has a low baseline agreement (~15%) due to the cost barrier and the fact that comprehensive insurance is not a universal priority. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the high-relevance topline 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.15, relevance=0.98), which is very close to the baseline for this category and supports a low agreement estimate. The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', which may slightly increase risk aversion, but not enough to shift the baseline significantly. No strong demographic calibration applies. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline, with a slight nudge toward higher disagreement due to the cost-conscious, practical nature of the segment and the low topline value for a similar 'important feature' item. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The topline quantitative evidence shows very low rates of vegan and vegetarian diets and a high prevalence of meat-eating in the semi-rural, mature segment. This supports the use of the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' baseline for agreement with 'Healthy Eating' as an attitudinal concept, rather than a behavioral one. The rationale consistently explains that while some aspiration toward healthy eating may exist, actual dietary behaviors do not reflect strong health-motivation, so the baseline is not adjusted upward. The demographic context (semi-rural, mature) is appropriately considered, and the confidence is high due to the direct relevance and strength of the quantitative evidence. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 26.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' falls under the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%). The quantitative evidence shows extremely low rates of vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.5%) diets, with a high prevalence of meat-eating (77%) and some pescatarian/flexitarian/other (17%). This indicates that while there may be some aspirational or attitudinal support for healthy eating, actual dietary behaviors in this semi-rural, mature segment are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-driven diets. Therefore, the baseline is appropriate, and the evidence does not justify upward calibration. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence directly relevant to eating habits.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is best classified under the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows extremely low vegan (1.4%) and vegetarian (4.5%) rates, with a high prevalence of meat-eating (77%) and moderate pescatarian/flexitarian (17%). This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary change is limited, and the population is not strongly health-motivated in their eating habits. This supports the baseline, with no evidence to increase agreement. Demographic calibration for 'semi-rural maturity' (likely older, less urban) does not significantly shift the baseline. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows that only a small minority in this semi-rural, mature segment are vegan (1.4%) or vegetarian (4.5%), with the vast majority (77%) eating meat and 17% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. According to the semantic category framework, 'Healthy Eating' falls under Health-Conscious Attitudes, which has a baseline of ~38% agreement (SA+A). The quantitative evidence indicates that this segment is less likely than average to strongly endorse health-focused eating, so the distribution is shifted slightly toward neutrality and disagreement. Demographic calibration (semi-rural, mature) does not significantly increase health-conscious agreement. Thus, the estimate is: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence provided is about actual eating behaviors (very low vegan/vegetarian rates, high meat consumption) in a semi-rural, mature segment. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, the actual adoption of health-oriented diets is low. According to the semantic category framework, 'Healthy Eating' as an attitude falls under 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' (~38% agreement baseline). The strong behavioral evidence (77% eat meat, only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian) indicates that even if the attitude is present, it is not strongly acted upon, so the agreement should not be higher than the baseline. Therefore, I use the category baseline (SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%) and do not increase it, as the evidence suggests a weak translation of attitude to behavior in this segment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept 'Healthy Eating' is an attitude, but the quantitative evidence shows that only 1% are vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 17% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, with 77% eating meat. This suggests that while some may aspire to healthy eating, actual dietary choices are not strongly aligned with restrictive or health-focused diets. This fits the 'Health-Conscious Attitudes' semantic category (~38% agreement baseline). The evidence indicates a moderate but not high level of agreement with healthy eating attitudes, so the baseline is appropriate. No strong demographic calibration is needed as the segment is semi-rural and mature, which may slightly reduce agreement with health trends, but not dramatically. The distribution reflects moderate agreement, a large neutral group, and a significant minority who disagree, matching the evidence and category pattern.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale clearly distinguishes between general attitudes (self-reliance) and specific behaviors (retirement planning, saving for a purpose), correctly noting that agreement with broad, socially desirable identity statements is typically higher than with specific financial behaviors. The use of a category baseline (~60% agreement) is appropriate, and the demographic calibration for a semi-rural, mature segment is reasonable and well-explained. The evidence selection is transparent, and the lack of contradictory evidence supports the high confidence in the estimate. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 23.80%
  Slightly agree: 35.40%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.40%
  Slightly disagree: 12.20%
  Strongly disagree: 8.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a statement about personal responsibility and competence, and such statements are generally viewed positively due to social desirability and cultural norms around self-sufficiency, especially in semi-rural, mature segments. The closest quantitative evidence is 'I only save for a specific purpose' (0.28) and 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' (0.14), both of which are lower, but these reflect specific behaviors or plans, not general attitudes about responsibility. The general attitude is likely to be higher than specific behaviors. No strong evidence contradicts the baseline, so the category baseline is used with no major demographic calibration (semi-rural, mature: possibly slightly higher self-reliance, but not enough to shift the baseline).
Run 2: Strongly agree=24.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is a positive self-concept statement about personal responsibility, which is generally high due to social desirability and cultural norms around self-sufficiency, especially in semi-rural, mature segments. The closest quantitative evidence is about specific retirement planning behaviors (e.g., 'Plans to use other investments for retirement' at 14%), but this is a behavior, not an attitude, and is much lower due to the effort and financial commitment required. The attitude 'I only save for a specific purpose' is 28%, but this is more restrictive than the broader self-reliance concept. No direct evidence contradicts the category baseline, so the estimate remains close to the 60% agreement baseline, with a slight upward calibration for this demographic (mature, semi-rural: likely to value self-reliance). Distribution: SA 24%, A 36%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of conflicting evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=24.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is because it is a statement about personal responsibility and competence, which tends to be socially desirable and widely endorsed, especially in semi-rural, mature segments. Quantitative evidence is not directly on this concept but supports the pattern: low intent to use 'other investments for retirement' (14%) suggests a traditional, self-reliant approach; moderate agreement with 'I only save for a specific purpose' (28%) and 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' (33%) indicate a pragmatic, somewhat cautious financial attitude. No evidence suggests a dramatic deviation from the baseline. Demographic calibration: semi-rural, mature audiences tend to be slightly more self-reliant (+3pp agreement). Therefore, the estimate is: Strongly agree 24%, Slightly agree 36%, Neither 20%, Slightly disagree 12%, Strongly disagree 8%.
Run 4: Strongly agree=22.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is a positive self-concept/competence statement, and social desirability bias tends to inflate agreement. The segment is 'semi-rural maturity,' which likely skews older and more self-reliant (rural +3pp for self-reliance, older +3pp). However, the closest quantitative evidence ("Plans to use other investments for retirement" at 14%) is much lower, but this is a behavior/plan, not an attitude. The attitude baseline should remain higher. Other evidence ("I only save for a specific purpose" at 28%, "Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort" at 33%) are effort/behavior items and not directly comparable. Therefore, I use the category baseline (60% agreement), apply a small upward calibration (+6pp for rural/older), but keep the neutral/disagree side slightly elevated due to some evidence of low proactive retirement planning. Final: SA 22%, A 34%, N 22%, D 13%, SD 9%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and moderate evidence alignment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=24.00%, Slightly agree=36.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') fits the 'Self-Reliance Identity' semantic category, which typically sees ~60% agreement (SA+A). This is a positive self-concept/competence statement, and social desirability bias tends to inflate agreement. The quantitative evidence provided is mostly about related financial attitudes and behaviors, but none directly contradict the baseline: 'I only save for a specific purpose' (0.28) and 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' (0.33) are lower, but these are effort/cost behaviors, not identity statements. The closest relevant evidence is the general tendency for moderate agreement with self-reliance in financial matters in semi-rural, mature segments. No evidence suggests a need to lower the baseline. Demographic calibration: semi-rural maturity may slightly increase self-reliance (+3pp), but not enough to shift the category. Final estimate: SA 24%, A 36%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references both the quantitative evidence (notably high outgoings on utilities, which could motivate switching) and the behavioral context (low engagement in non-routine activities, effort aversion, and demographic inertia in a semi-rural, mature segment). The repeated use of the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' baseline is appropriate, and the evidence does not suggest a need for significant deviation from this baseline. The confidence is high due to strong alignment with established behavioral patterns and the absence of contradictory evidence. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The statement 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' falls under the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, while switching suppliers can save money (cost-consciousness), the perceived hassle and time investment deter many people. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities, which could motivate switching, but actual behavioral data (from similar populations) consistently shows inertia and low switching rates. The semi-rural, mature segment may be even less likely to switch due to habit and risk aversion, but the baseline for effort-required behaviors (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) fits well. No strong demographic calibration is warranted here. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with established behavioral patterns.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' falls into the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category is characterized by actions that require significant time or effort, which typically see low agreement due to inertia and effort aversion, even if there is a potential cost-saving. The baseline for this category is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement). 

The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (council tax, water, electricity, gas), which could increase motivation to switch, but the actual behavioral data (e.g., only 17% attend sporting events, 9% places of worship) suggests low engagement in non-routine activities, reinforcing the idea that effortful behaviors are not widely adopted. No direct evidence suggests this segment is unusually proactive about switching. 

Demographic calibrations (semi-rural, mature) do not strongly shift the baseline: older, semi-rural populations may be slightly less likely to switch due to inertia and satisfaction with the status quo, but this is already reflected in the low baseline. 

Therefore, the estimate remains close to the category baseline, with high confidence due to strong alignment with established patterns.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' falls under the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, while switching suppliers can save money (cost-consciousness), the perceived hassle and time investment create significant inertia. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting potential benefit from switching), but this does not override the general reluctance to undertake effortful tasks. There is no direct evidence of high switching rates or strong positive attitudes toward the effort involved. Demographic calibration for a semi-rural, mature audience does not significantly shift the baseline, as this group may be somewhat more set in their ways and less likely to switch. Therefore, the baseline distribution for effort-required behaviors is used, with a slight nudge toward disagreement due to the likely inertia in this segment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' falls under the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, while there may be a rational benefit (potential cost savings), the perceived hassle and inertia of switching providers is a significant barrier for most people. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (council tax, water, etc.), which could motivate some to consider switching, but actual behavioral follow-through is limited by effort aversion. The segment is 'semi-rural maturity,' which may slightly increase agreement due to higher cost sensitivity, but not enough to override the baseline. No direct evidence suggests a higher-than-baseline willingness to switch. Therefore, the estimate closely follows the category baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with established behavioral patterns.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' falls under the 'Effort-Required Behaviors' semantic category. This category typically sees low agreement (~30%) because, while switching suppliers can save money, it requires time, research, and administrative effort—barriers that deter many, especially in older or less digitally confident segments. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting potential savings are relevant), but actual behavioral indicators (e.g., low sporting event and place of worship attendance) suggest a relatively passive lifestyle, not one characterized by proactive effort. No evidence suggests this segment is unusually effort-seeking. Therefore, the baseline (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong category fit and supporting evidence.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references both the quantitative toplines (showing low online purchase rates for everyday categories among the 'ACORN Semi-Rural Maturity' segment) and the qualitative demographic profile (older, more traditional, semi-rural), both of which support a higher-than-average preference for cash. The calibration from the baseline is moderate and well-explained, and the confidence is appropriately high given the strong alignment between evidence and prediction. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 15.60%

Run 1: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The target concept ('I like to use cash when making purchases') fits the payment preference category, which has a baseline of ~37% agreement (SA+A). The segment is 'ACORN Class: Semi-Rural Maturity', which typically skews older and more traditional, and rural/older demographics are more likely to prefer cash (category calibration: +5pp for elderly, +3pp for rural). However, the quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 23%), suggesting a higher-than-average preference for offline/cash transactions. Therefore, I slightly increase agreement from the baseline, but not dramatically, as cash preference is declining overall. Final estimate: SA 15%, A 22%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13%. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between category, segment, and evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('I like to use cash when making purchases') fits the 'Cash/Payment Preferences' semantic category, which has a baseline of ~37% agreement (SA+A). The segment is 'ACORN Class: Semi-Rural Maturity', which skews older and more traditional, and in V6 this group gets a +5pp calibration for cash preference. However, the quantitative evidence shows that online purchasing rates are relatively low for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 23%), but higher for home appliances (52%) and holidays (55%). This suggests that for routine purchases, this group is less likely to use digital/online methods, implying a higher preference for cash. Therefore, I increase the agreement slightly above the baseline, but not dramatically, as online penetration is still significant for some categories. The final estimate is: SA 18%, A 22%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 12%. Confidence is high due to strong segment fit and relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The statement 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the payment preference category, which typically sees moderate agreement (baseline: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13%). The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 23%), and moderate rates for higher-ticket items (home appliances 52%, holidays 55%) in the semi-rural maturity segment. This suggests a population less digitally oriented and more likely to prefer traditional payment methods, such as cash, especially for routine purchases. The semi-rural, older demographic further supports a slight upward calibration for cash preference (+2pp to SA, -2pp to A, reflecting more polarization). The final estimate is slightly above the general baseline for cash preference, reflecting both the demographic and the low online purchase rates for everyday goods.
Run 4: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The statement 'I like to use cash when making purchases' fits the payment preference category, which typically sees moderate agreement (baseline: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13%). The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 23%), suggesting this semi-rural, mature segment is less digitally oriented and more likely to prefer traditional payment methods like cash. This supports a slight upward calibration from the baseline, especially given the demographic (semi-rural, older), which aligns with higher cash preference (+2pp SA, -2pp SD). However, the agreement is not overwhelming, as online purchasing for higher-ticket items (home appliances, holidays) is still substantial (52-55%), indicating some digital adoption. Therefore, the final estimate is: SA 15%, A 22%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13%. Confidence is high due to strong segment fit and relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Semantic category: Cash/Payment Preferences. The target concept ('I like to use cash when making purchases') fits the payment method preference category, which has a baseline of ~37% agreement (SA+A). Quantitative evidence from the semi-rural maturity segment shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 23%), suggesting a higher-than-average preference for traditional payment methods, including cash. This supports a modest upward calibration from the baseline. Demographically, semi-rural and mature populations tend to skew older, which further increases cash preference (+5pp agreement per calibration rules). Therefore, the final estimate is slightly above the baseline, with 37% agreement, 28% neutral, and 35% disagreement. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and clear demographic fit.
