### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.71
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale for each run correctly identifies that the quantitative toplines are only weakly relevant (low values, not directly about the target concept), and that there is no strong qualitative or demographic evidence to warrant deviation from the V3 attitude baseline. The repeated application of the balanced V3 attitude template is methodologically sound in the absence of direct or strongly relevant evidence. Confidence is appropriately rated as moderate-high due to the lack of direct evidence but strong template fit. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 30.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 27.00%
  Slightly disagree: 18.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' statement, so the V3 attitude baseline is used: SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. There is no direct quantitative evidence about the specific concept, and the retrieved segment toplines are only weakly relevant (all values <0.11, and none directly about the concept). No demographic calibration is triggered, as the segment is not flagged for high/low income or age. No concept-specific correction applies. The qualitative notes do not provide additional directional evidence. Therefore, the balanced V3 attitude template is applied. Confidence is moderate-high due to lack of direct evidence but strong template fit.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' statement, so the V3 attitude baseline is used: SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. The quantitative evidence provided is only weakly relevant (all values <0.11, and not directly about the target concept), so it does not justify a deviation from the baseline. There are no strong demographic calibrations indicated by the evidence (e.g., no high/low income, age, or strong identity cues). Qualitative notes are generic and do not suggest a need for adjustment. Therefore, the balanced V3 attitude template is applied. Confidence is moderate-high due to the lack of direct evidence but strong template fit.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' statement, so the V3 attitude baseline is used: SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. The quantitative evidence provided (all values <0.11) is weak and not directly related to the concept, so it does not justify a significant adjustment. There are no strong demographic signals or concept-specific corrections indicated. Qualitative evidence is minimal and does not suggest deviation from the baseline. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence and the use of the generic attitude template.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is classified as 'attitude', which uses the V3 attitude baseline: SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. The quantitative evidence provided is not directly related to the target concept (very low values for 'manage/arrange account by phone' and 'country of birth'), so it does not warrant a deviation from the baseline. There are no strong qualitative cues or demographic calibrations that would shift the estimate. The evidence hierarchy prioritizes direct quantitative data, but none is available for the specific attitude in question. Therefore, the balanced V3 attitude template is applied. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence but high relevance of the template.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' statement, so the V3 attitude baseline is used: SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. There is no strong quantitative evidence to shift the baseline (the retrieved values are all very low and pertain to unrelated behaviors, not attitudes). No demographic calibration is warranted as the segment is not clearly high/low income, young/elderly, or otherwise flagged. Qualitative evidence is minimal and does not suggest deviation from the baseline. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence, but the V3 baseline is robust for generic attitude items.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The prediction for agreement with 'I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events' is anchored to the V3 concept-specific correction, which is appropriate given the available evidence. The direct quantitative data shows very low self-identification as environmentalists (7%) and low trust in energy companies' environmental care (25%), supporting the use of a moderate, not high, agreement level. The rationale correctly notes that the attitude statement is less personally demanding than self-identification, justifying a higher agreement than the direct 'environmentalist' item. The repeated application of the V3 template is well-supported by the evidence hierarchy, and the confidence is appropriately high. No additional qualitative evidence is available to warrant adjustment. Overall, the estimate is methodologically sound and well-justified.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 15.00%
  Slightly agree: 30.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 17.00%
  Strongly disagree: 10.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. For this semi-rural, mature segment, direct quantitative evidence shows very low self-identification as environmentalist (7%) and low trust in energy companies' environmental care (25%). These suggest weak environmental engagement. The V3 template for this concept is: SA 15%, A 30%, N 28%, D 17%, SD 10% (45% agreement), which is already calibrated for moderate skepticism. No evidence suggests this group is more pro-environmental than average, so no upward adjustment is warranted. The prediction is therefore anchored to the V3 concept-specific correction for this item type, with high confidence due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. For this semi-rural, mature segment, direct quantitative evidence shows low self-identification as environmentalists (7%) and moderate skepticism toward energy companies' environmental care (25%). There is no direct evidence for the event-specific sustainability attitude, but the V3 template for this concept (attitude, with a +10pp correction for this specific item) is: SA 15%, A 30%, N 28%, D 17%, SD 10%. This matches the evidence hierarchy: direct quant (low), related quant (moderate), and the concept-specific correction. The prediction is slightly higher than the segment's baseline environmentalism due to the broader, less personally demanding nature of the statement (brands should consider, not 'I do'). Confidence is high due to strong alignment with both the V3 template and the available evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement for a semi-rural, mature segment. The most relevant quantitative evidence is very low agreement with 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (7%) and low agreement with 'energy companies do not care about the environment' (25%). The V3 template for this concept ('environmental sustainability when putting on events') is 15/30/28/17/10, reflecting a moderate but not high level of agreement (45% total agreement). Given the segment's low self-identification as environmentalists, there is no reason to increase the agreement above the V3 baseline. No strong qualitative evidence is present to shift the estimate. Therefore, the V3 attitude template is applied without upward correction. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors.
Run 4: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events'). For V3, the balanced baseline for attitudes is SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. However, V3 specifies a concept-specific upward correction (+10pp agreement) for this exact item, due to V2's under-prediction. This yields: SA 15%, A 30%, N 28%, D 17%, SD 10%. Quantitative evidence from this segment shows very low self-identification as environmentalist (7%) and low trust in energy companies' environmental care (25%), suggesting environmental concern is present but not dominant. No evidence suggests a need to further increase or decrease the V3 template for this item. Therefore, the V3 concept-specific correction is applied directly. Confidence is high due to direct match with the concept-specific correction and supporting quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement about brands and environmental sustainability at events. The most relevant direct quantitative evidence is the very low proportion (7%) who consider themselves environmentalists, and a modest 25% who think energy companies do not care about the environment. These suggest a generally low-to-moderate environmental concern in this semi-rural, mature segment. The V3 template for this specific concept (environmental sustainability at events) is: SA 15%, A 30%, N 28%, D 17%, SD 10% (45% agreement), which is slightly higher than the direct evidence but reflects the broader tendency for people to express more support for sustainability in general questions than in self-identity. No evidence suggests a need to adjust this baseline downward, and the segment's maturity and semi-rural profile do not indicate higher environmental engagement. Therefore, the V3 concept-specific correction is applied as the best estimate, with moderate-high confidence due to strong direct evidence.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V3 guidance, which specifies a concept-specific correction (+13pp) for this universally cost-conscious item. The segment ('semi-rural maturity') is plausibly cost-aware, as supported by the high outgoings on housing/utilities (73%), which increases the salience of energy-saving behaviors. While direct quantitative evidence for this specific attitude is limited, there is no evidence contradicting the high agreement rate, and the universal tendency to economize on energy is well established. The repeated application of the V3 template (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%) is appropriate given the evidence hierarchy and segment fit. Confidence is high due to strong template match and lack of contradictory evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.00%
  Slightly agree: 40.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 15.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude ('make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home'), but V3 guidance specifies a concept-specific correction: this item is universally cost-conscious and should be increased by +13pp over the standard attitude baseline. The base for this item is thus: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', which typically skews toward older, cost-aware, and practical behaviors, but the quantitative evidence for similar pro-efficiency attitudes is low (e.g., only 15% agree with 'I make an effort to support local businesses'). However, the outgoings data (73% on housing/utilities) suggests high salience of these costs. No evidence contradicts the universal tendency to economize on energy. Therefore, the concept-specific correction dominates, and the distribution is set accordingly. Confidence is high due to strong V3 evidence hierarchy and universal cost-consciousness.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a cost-conscious, low-friction behavior. V3 guidance specifically calls for a +13pp upward correction for this item, reflecting its universal relevance and prior under-prediction. The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', likely older and cost-aware, but not especially digitally engaged (low agreement with chatbots and computers). No direct quantitative anchor for this exact item, but the high outgoings on utilities (73%) suggest salience. The V3 template for this item is: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). This matches the evidence hierarchy (universal cost-consciousness, segment likely to be attentive to household costs). Confidence is high due to strong template match and segment fit.
Run 3: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is a high-salience, low-friction cost-consciousness behavior, and V3 guidance specifies a +13pp correction for this item (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%). The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', which typically aligns with higher cost-awareness and traditional values, but the direct evidence for this specific behavior is not present. However, the high outgoings on housing/utilities (73%) suggest this is a salient expense, likely increasing motivation to cut down. The other attitude items (supporting local, digital confusion) are low, but not directly relevant. Therefore, the V3 concept-specific correction is applied as the best estimate, with moderate-high confidence due to strong template fit and segment plausibility.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude ('make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home'), but V3 guidance specifies a concept-specific correction: this item is universally cost-conscious and should be increased by +13pp over the attitude baseline. The base for attitudes is SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%, but for this item, V3 recommends SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment is 'semi-rural maturity'—likely older, cost-aware, and with high outgoings on housing/utilities (73.08), which supports a high agreement rate. No evidence suggests a lower-than-average agreement. Quantitative evidence is limited but does not contradict the universal tendency. Confidence is high due to strong V3 correction and segment fit.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is a high-consensus, low-friction cost-consciousness attitude. V3 guidance specifies a +13pp correction for this item, as both V1 and V2 under-predicted agreement. The base for this concept is SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', which typically skews toward cost-consciousness and practical attitudes, but there is no direct quantitative evidence to suggest a lower or higher agreement than the V3 template. The outgoings data (73% on housing/utilities) supports the salience of this category. No demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to strong template match and universal relevance of the item.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The simulated survey prediction for 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' is well-grounded in the provided evidence. The main quantitative anchor ('Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions', value=0.38) is conceptually related but not identical, and the rationale correctly notes this distinction. The use of the V3 template for this specific concept is appropriate given the evidence hierarchy and the segment profile (semi-rural, mature), which does not suggest a strong deviation from the general population. The repeated rationales consistently reference the available quantitative data, segment characteristics, and the limitations of the evidence, resulting in a conservative and justified estimate. No corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 5.00%
  Slightly agree: 15.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 30.00%
  Strongly disagree: 22.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement about car-buying priorities, specifically fuel consumption. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.38), which is conceptually similar but not identical (environmental concern vs. fuel economy). The V3 template for this concept (see prompt) is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22% (20% agreement), which matches the evidence that only a minority prioritize fuel or environmental features as the most important. The segment (semi-rural, mature) is not likely to be more eco-focused than average, and the evidence for 'well insured' (0.12) and 'researched pet care' (0.22) both suggest low-to-moderate engagement with such priorities. No demographic calibration is needed. The distribution maintains high variance and aligns with the evidence hierarchy, with direct quantitative data (0.38) as the main anchor. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the evidence shows only moderate concern for environmental and fuel-related car features in this segment (quant topline: 0.38 for 'environmentally friendly/low CO2 emissions' as important when buying a car). This is not a high value, and the segment is semi-rural/mature, which typically places less emphasis on fuel economy as the top priority compared to cost, reliability, or comfort. The V3 template for this concept (see prompt) is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22% (20% agreement), which matches the evidence and segment profile. There is no evidence to suggest a higher agreement, and the provided data supports a low agreement baseline. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and strong alignment with the V3 template.
Run 3: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: This is an attitude item for a semi-rural, mature segment. The closest quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 38%, but this is a broader environmental concern, not specifically fuel consumption. The V3 template for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22% (20% agreement), which matches the evidence that this is a relatively low-priority feature for this segment. The segment's low agreement with environmental and insurance attitudes (25% and 12% respectively) further supports a low agreement estimate. No demographic calibration is needed as this is not a high-income or elderly segment. The distribution maintains high variance and aligns with both the V3 template and the quantitative topline. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.
Run 4: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement for a semi-rural, mature segment. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 38%, but this is not the same as fuel consumption (environmental concern is related but not identical to cost/fuel efficiency). The V3 template for this specific concept ('fuel consumption most important') is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22% (20% agreement), which matches the evidence that only a minority prioritize fuel consumption above all else. The segment is semi-rural/mature, which might slightly increase practical concerns about fuel cost, but not enough to override the low baseline. The evidence hierarchy is strong (direct quant for a related but not identical concept), so the V3 concept-specific template is applied with high confidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' According to the V3 template for this specific concept, we should use the established correction: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22% (20% agreement). This is supported by the direct quantitative topline for a closely related action ('Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions', value=0.38), which is higher than the V3 template but not directly about fuel consumption as the most important feature. The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', which does not suggest a strong deviation from the general population for this item. No qualitative evidence suggests a higher or lower valuation. The evidence hierarchy prioritizes the direct quantitative data, but since the provided value (0.38) is for a related but not identical concept, the V3 template is most appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with both the template and the available evidence.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is well justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently references the segment's low risk-taking (0.18), low community engagement (0.09), and low likelihood to move (0.26), all of which support a cautious, stability-oriented, and financially conservative profile. The use of the V3 template for this specific attitude item (SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%) is appropriate, as it is already calibrated for this type of segment and aligns with the evidence. There is no direct quantitative evidence for this exact item, but the indirect evidence is strong and consistently interpreted across runs. No further demographic or qualitative calibration is needed. The confidence in the estimate is high, and no corrective action is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an 'attitude' item, so the V3 baseline is SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. However, the segment (semi-rural maturity) shows low risk-taking (0.18), low community engagement (0.09), and low likelihood to move (0.26), all suggesting a cautious, stability-oriented profile. This supports a slightly higher aversion to debt than the general population. The V3 template for this item is already well-calibrated (per system prompt: 'don't like being in debt' uses SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%). Quantitative evidence does not directly address debt, but the low risk-taking and stability orientation justify using the template without further upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment characteristics and the concept.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an 'attitude' item, but with a strong normative component (disliking debt is common, especially in older, semi-rural, mature segments). The V3 template for 'I don't like being in debt' is: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence for risk aversion (low willingness to take risks with money: 0.18) and low community activism (0.09) both suggest a cautious, conservative profile, which aligns with a higher-than-average dislike of debt. However, the evidence does not support an extreme aversion (e.g., 60%+ agreement), so the V3 template is appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed as the segment is not flagged as especially high or low income, nor especially elderly. Confidence is high due to direct concept-specific template and supporting quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an 'attitude' item, but the concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') is known to have a relatively high agreement baseline, especially among older, semi-rural, mature segments who tend to be risk-averse and financially conservative. The V3 template for this specific item is: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (43% agreement), which matches the evidence hierarchy and prior calibration. Quantitative evidence from this segment shows low risk-taking (0.18) and low community activism (0.09), both supporting a conservative, debt-averse profile. No direct quantitative for this exact item, but all evidence points to a cautious, debt-averse attitude. No demographic calibration is needed as the V3 template already fits this segment's profile. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment characteristics and the concept.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), so the V3 attitude template is the baseline: SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. However, the quantitative evidence for this semi-rural maturity segment shows low levels of risk-taking (0.18), low likelihood to move (0.26), low community engagement (0.09), and moderate concern about climate change (0.22). These suggest a cautious, risk-averse, and possibly conservative profile, which would likely increase agreement with the statement. The V3 template for 'don't like being in debt' is already calibrated (SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%) and matches well with the evidence. No further demographic calibration is needed as this is not a high-income, low-income, or age-specific group. Confidence is high due to alignment between template and evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude statement, so the V3 baseline for attitudes is used (SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%). However, the quantitative evidence for this segment shows relatively low agreement with other strong attitudes (e.g., only 22% agree that climate change is the biggest threat, and only 9% are involved in community helping). This suggests a generally low tendency to strongly endorse attitudinal statements. However, dislike of debt is a near-universal attitude in UK semi-rural mature segments, and V3's template for this specific item is calibrated to SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (43% agreement), which matches the evidence hierarchy and maintains the improved variance. No further demographic calibration is needed as this segment is not flagged as high or low income, nor particularly young or elderly. Confidence is high due to the direct V3 template match and supporting evidence.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I am very good at managing money' (SA 30%, A 35%, N 18%, D 10%, SD 7%) is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V3 identity template and the concept-specific correction (+24pp agreement), as required by the latest methodological guidance. The quantitative evidence (high private car ownership, moderate online savings management, high miscellaneous spending) is relevant and supports the segment's financial stability and self-efficacy, aligning with the identity template. There is no strong evidence suggesting the need for further demographic calibration or deviation from the template. The qualitative segment profile is referenced appropriately. Confidence is high due to the strong alignment with both template guidance and available evidence. No revision is needed.

Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' is an IDENTITY item, not just an attitude, so the V3 template for identity (SA 25%, A 37%, N 16%, D 13%, SD 9%) is the correct baseline. V3 further specifies a +24pp correction for this concept due to systematic under-prediction in V2. For the ACORN 'Semi-Rural Maturity' segment, there is no strong evidence of deviation from the national average for this identity statement, but the segment's high rate of private car ownership (0.90), moderate online savings management (0.31), and high miscellaneous spending (41.05) suggest financial stability and confidence, supporting the use of the higher identity baseline. No demographic calibration is needed. Quantitative evidence is indirect but consistent with a self-assured, stable segment. Therefore, the V3 concept-specific correction is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong template guidance and segment fit.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' is an IDENTITY item, which V3 guidance says should use the identity template (base: 25% strongly agree, 37% slightly agree, 16% neither, 13% slightly disagree, 9% strongly disagree). However, V3 also specifies a concept-specific correction for this item (+24pp agreement) due to systematic under-prediction in prior versions. This yields: SA 30%, A 35%, N 18%, D 10%, SD 7% (65% agreement). 

Demographically, 'Semi-Rural Maturity' is likely to skew older, more financially stable, and more self-assured, but the evidence does not indicate a need for further upward calibration beyond the V3 correction. Quantitative evidence (e.g., 31% manage savings online, high private car ownership) suggests financial competence and stability, supporting the higher self-assessment. No direct evidence contradicts the high self-efficacy. 

Confidence is high due to strong V3 guidance, direct concept-specific correction, and supportive segment evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' is best classified as an IDENTITY item, not just an attitude, per V3 guidance. The V3 template for this is: SA 30%, A 35%, N 18%, D 10%, SD 7% (65% agreement). This is a direct correction from V2, which under-predicted self-efficacy/identity statements. The segment (ACORN Semi-Rural Maturity) is likely to skew slightly older and more financially stable, but the evidence does not indicate a need for further upward calibration beyond the V3 identity template. Quantitative evidence (e.g., 31% manage savings online, high private car ownership) suggests financial competence but not exceptional digital engagement, supporting the use of the base identity template. No strong evidence for further demographic adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong template match and moderate supporting quant evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' is an IDENTITY item, not just an attitude, and should use the V3 identity template as per the system prompt. For this segment (ACORN Semi-Rural Maturity), there is no direct quantitative evidence about self-perceived money management, but the group is likely older, stable, and has high rates of car ownership (89.6% privately owned), moderate online banking (31%), and low crime worry (2%). These suggest financial stability and self-efficacy. The V3 template for this concept is: SA 30%, A 35%, N 18%, D 10%, SD 7% (65% agreement), which already incorporates the +24pp correction for this specific item. No further demographic calibration is needed as this segment is not flagged as especially high or low income, nor especially young or elderly. Confidence is high due to strong template match and segment fit.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' is an IDENTITY item, not just an attitude, so the V3 template for identity (SA 25%, A 37%, N 16%, D 13%, SD 9%) is the correct baseline. V3 mandates a +24pp correction for this specific concept due to systematic under-prediction in V2. The segment, 'Semi-Rural Maturity', is likely to skew slightly older and more financially stable, but the quantitative evidence (e.g., 31% manage savings online, high private car ownership) suggests moderate digital engagement and financial self-sufficiency, supporting the high self-efficacy baseline. No evidence suggests lowering the estimate. Therefore, the concept-specific correction is applied directly: SA 30%, A 35%, N 18%, D 10%, SD 7%. Confidence is high due to strong evidence hierarchy and direct V3 correction.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for agreement with 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is well justified. The rationale consistently references both the V3 template and the segment-specific quantitative evidence, particularly the low agreement with similar 'practical/cautious' attitudes (e.g., fuel consumption importance at 15%). The repeated application of the V3 template is appropriate given the lack of evidence for higher insurance prioritization in this segment, and the absence of qualitative evidence suggesting otherwise. The confidence is high due to strong alignment between the predicted distribution and the available data, with no conflicting evidence. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude statement. According to the V3 template, the base for attitudes is SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. However, V2 and V3 both recommend a much lower agreement for this specific item, based on prior quantitative evidence and observed under-prediction bias. The segment (semi-rural maturity) shows low agreement with other 'practical/cautious' attitudes (e.g., only 15% agree that fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car), suggesting a pragmatic but not risk-averse mindset. The V3 template for this item (well insured for everything) is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement), which matches the evidence hierarchy and maintains the improved variance. There is no strong demographic calibration needed for this segment. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and strong template fit.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is an attitude statement, but V3 guidance treats it as a special case due to consistent over-claim in self-reporting and low actual agreement in UK population data. The quantitative evidence for this segment (semi-rural, mature) shows low agreement with similar 'practical' or 'risk-averse' attitudes (e.g., only 15% agree that fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car). V3's template for this item is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement), which matches the evidence and maintains the necessary variance. There is no evidence to suggest this segment is more risk-averse or insurance-focused than the general population, so no upward demographic calibration is applied. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with both the V3 template and the segment's quantitative profile.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The item 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is an attitude statement, not an identity or high-friction behavior. According to the V3 template, the base for this item is the V2-corrected distribution (SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%), which is retained because V2's prediction for this item was accurate (error +4.5pp). The segment (semi-rural maturity) shows low agreement with other 'practical/cautious' attitudes (e.g., only 15% agree that fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a car), suggesting a low tendency to prioritize risk-averse or insurance-related attitudes. No evidence suggests a need to increase the agreement rate. Therefore, the V2/V3 template is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and no conflicting qualitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is an attitude statement, but prior V2 and V3 calibration show that agreement is much lower than intuition suggests, especially in semi-rural, mature segments. The V3 template for this item is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). Quantitative evidence for similar 'fuel consumption' attitudes in this segment is low (0.15), supporting a low-agreement prediction. There is no evidence of strong insurance focus in the qualitative notes. The segment's moderate mass-market orientation (0.51) does not suggest a strong bias toward insurance. Therefore, the V3 template is applied without upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and robust template calibration.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is an attitude statement, not an identity or high-friction behavior. According to the V3 template for this specific item, the correct distribution is SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. This is based on V2's accurate calibration for this item, which is supported by the low agreement in similar segments and the lack of strong evidence for high insurance prioritization in the provided quantitative toplines (e.g., fuel consumption, adverts, and mass market clothing are not directly related to insurance attitudes). The segment (semi-rural, maturity) does not suggest a strong deviation from the base, and no demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is high due to direct concept-specific correction and alignment with available evidence.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes in the semi-rural, mature segment is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V3 template, which incorporates a +7pp correction for this concept due to prior under-prediction. The quantitative evidence on eating habits (very low vegan/vegetarian rates, majority meat-eating) is correctly interpreted as not directly contradicting a positive attitude toward healthy eating, since attitudes and behaviors can diverge. There is no evidence suggesting this segment is unusually positive or negative compared to the general population, and the qualitative notes do not provide grounds for further adjustment. The confidence is appropriately high, given the strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and V3 guidance. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 20.00%
  Slightly agree: 40.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 8.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=20.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude item ('Healthy Eating') for a semi-rural, mature segment. The quantitative data shows a strong majority (77%) eat meat, with only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, and 17% pescatarian/flexitarian/other. This suggests that while actual dietary behavior is not strongly plant-based, it does not directly contradict a positive attitude toward healthy eating, as many omnivores still value healthy eating in principle. V3 guidance for 'Healthy Eating' is to use a slightly increased agreement baseline (SA 20%, A 40%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%), reflecting that most people endorse healthy eating as a value even if their behavior is not strictly aligned. No evidence suggests this segment is unusually negative or positive compared to the general population, so the V3 template is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence on eating habits, though it is indirect for attitudes.
Run 2: Strongly agree=20.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude), and the V3 baseline for this is SA 20%, A 40%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8% (60% agreement). The quantitative data shows that only a small minority are vegan (1.4%) or vegetarian (4.5%), with the vast majority eating meat (77%) and a notable minority pescatarian/flexitarian (17%). This suggests that while actual dietary behavior is not strongly plant-based, it does not directly contradict a positive attitude toward healthy eating, as many omnivores still endorse healthy eating in principle. There is no evidence to suggest this segment is less likely to endorse healthy eating than the general population, so the V3 concept-specific correction (+7pp) is appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and alignment with the V3 template.
Run 3: Strongly agree=20.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is 'Healthy Eating' for a semi-rural, mature segment. The item is classified as an attitude, so the V3 attitude baseline is SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. However, V3 guidance specifies a +7pp increase for 'Healthy Eating' due to V2 under-prediction, resulting in SA 20%, A 40%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8% (60% agreement). Quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, 17% pescatarian/flexitarian, and 77% eat meat, indicating low prevalence of restrictive diets but not necessarily low agreement with healthy eating as an attitude. The evidence hierarchy prioritizes the concept-specific correction (+7pp) over the baseline, and the demographic (semi-rural, mature) does not warrant further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with V3's evidence-based correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=20.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude), for a semi-rural, mature segment. V3 baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is SA 20%, A 40%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8% (60% agreement), which already includes a +7pp correction for under-prediction in V2. Quantitative evidence shows only 1% vegan, 4% vegetarian, 17% pescatarian/flexitarian/other, and 77% eat meat, indicating low prevalence of restrictive diets but not necessarily low agreement with healthy eating as an attitude. The segment is not highly health-restrictive, but the attitude toward healthy eating can be higher than actual restrictive behavior. No evidence suggests a need to further adjust the V3 baseline. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative data and a well-calibrated V3 template.
Run 5: Strongly agree=20.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating', classified as an attitude. V3 baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is SA 20%, A 40%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8% (60% agreement), reflecting a slight increase over V2 due to prior under-prediction. Quantitative data shows a strong majority (77%) eat meat, with only 1% vegan and 4% vegetarian, suggesting this segment is not highly health-restrictive in diet. However, this does not directly contradict a positive attitude toward healthy eating, as many omnivores still value healthy choices. No direct quantitative data on 'healthy eating' attitudes is present, so the V3 template is used with high confidence, as there is no evidence to suggest this segment is less health-oriented than the general population. The qualitative notes do not provide additional evidence to adjust the baseline. Confidence is high due to the strong alignment with the V3 template and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V3 guidance for IDENTITY-type items, using the prescribed template (SA 28%, A 35%, N 18%, D 12%, SD 7%) and correctly notes that the available quantitative evidence (e.g., 14% plan to use other investments for retirement) is not directly about the attitudinal concept of responsibility, but rather about behavior. The evidence hierarchy is respected, with the template dominating due to weak direct quant evidence. There is no contradictory evidence, and the segment fit is well-argued. The confidence is appropriately high, and no corrective feedback is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 28.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 7.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is best classified as an IDENTITY item (self-reliance, self-concept), not just an attitude. V3 guidance specifies a substantial upward correction (+20pp) for this concept due to V2's systematic under-prediction. The base for IDENTITY is 62% agreement, and the concept-specific template is: SA 28%, A 35%, N 18%, D 12%, SD 7%. Quantitative evidence from this segment (semi-rural, maturity) shows relatively low proactivity in alternative retirement planning (14% plan to use other investments), moderate trust in financial tools (51%), and moderate utility switching (33%), suggesting a moderate but not extreme sense of self-reliance. No evidence contradicts the V3 template, so the concept-specific correction is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of conflicting evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is best classified as an IDENTITY-type item (self-reliance, personal responsibility). V3 guidance specifies that for this concept, the base distribution should be SA 28%, A 35%, N 18%, D 12%, SD 7% (63% agreement), reflecting strong self-reliance in the general population. The segment is 'semi-rural maturity,' which typically skews toward traditional, self-reliant attitudes, but the quantitative evidence provided is only weakly related (e.g., 14% plan to use other investments for retirement, 28% only save for a specific purpose, 33% think switching utilities is worth the effort). None of these directly contradict the high self-reliance baseline, and there is no evidence to suggest a lower sense of responsibility. Therefore, the V3 concept-specific correction is applied directly, with high confidence due to the strong fit between segment and concept type.
Run 3: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') is best classified as an IDENTITY statement, not just an attitude, per V3 guidance. This segment (semi-rural, maturity) is likely to have above-average agreement with self-reliance statements about retirement, but the direct quantitative evidence is limited. The closest quantitative anchor ('Plans to use other investments for retirement', 14%) is not directly comparable, as it measures alternative planning, not self-reliance. Other attitude items (e.g., 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort', 33%) suggest moderate agency, but not as high as urban/affluent segments. V3 prescribes a +20pp correction for this concept, using the IDENTITY template: SA 28%, A 35%, N 18%, D 12%, SD 7% (63% agreement). This is consistent with the segment's likely values and the evidence hierarchy (quantitative evidence is weak, so template dominates). Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') is best classified as an IDENTITY statement, not just an attitude, per V3 guidance. This segment (semi-rural, maturity) is likely to have a moderate-to-high sense of self-reliance, but the quantitative evidence shows relatively low proactive retirement planning (only 14% plan to use other investments for retirement). However, the concept is about responsibility, not actual behavior, so agreement will be higher than for action-based items. V3 prescribes a +20pp correction for this concept, using the IDENTITY template: SA 28%, A 35%, N 18%, D 12%, SD 7% (63% agreement). This is slightly above the base for identity statements, reflecting the segment's maturity and likely self-reliance, but not as high as for high-income or highly educated groups. Quantitative evidence is weighted at 80% but is not directly about responsibility, so it does not override the template. Confidence is high due to strong V3 guidance and segment fit.
Run 5: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') is best classified as an IDENTITY statement, not just an attitude, per V3 guidance. This segment (semi-rural, maturity) is likely to have above-average self-reliance, but the quantitative evidence shows relatively low proactive retirement planning (only 14% plan to use other investments for retirement), and moderate engagement with financial attitudes (e.g., 28% only save for a specific purpose, 33% think switching utilities is worth the effort). However, the V3 template for this concept is: SA 28%, A 35%, N 18%, D 12%, SD 7% (63% agreement), which already incorporates the necessary upward correction for self-reliance/identity. No further demographic calibration is needed, as this is not a high-income or elderly-specific segment. The evidence hierarchy is respected: direct quant data is low, but the concept is about attitude/identity, not behavior. Confidence is high due to strong template match and moderate evidence alignment.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run is consistent and well-grounded in the provided evidence. The topline quantitative data (utility outgoings, moderate engagement in community activities) supports the use of the V3 template for this segment, and the qualitative notes confirm the appropriateness of the selected distribution. There is clear reasoning for not applying demographic up-weighting or behavioral templates, and the evidence hierarchy is respected. The confidence is high due to strong template fit, prior calibration, and lack of contradictory evidence. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement about the perceived value of switching utility suppliers. The V3 baseline for 'behavior (high friction)' is not appropriate here, as switching utilities is a moderate-friction behavior but the statement is attitudinal (perceived worth, not actual switching). The V3 template for this specific item is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement), which is supported by prior calibration and matches the evidence hierarchy. Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting salience), but actual switching rates in similar UK segments are low, and qualitative evidence does not indicate unusually high engagement or activism. The segment is semi-rural, mature, with moderate engagement in community activities (e.g., sporting events 17%, places of worship 9%), suggesting neither high inertia nor high activism. Therefore, the V3 template is appropriate, with no demographic up-weighting. Confidence is high due to strong evidence fit and prior calibration.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: This is an 'attitude' item about the perceived value of switching utility suppliers. The V3 baseline for 'behavior (high friction)' is not appropriate here, as the question is about perceived worth, not actual switching behavior. The V3 attitude template is: SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. However, V2 and V3 both recommend a lower agreement for this item based on prior calibration and evidence: V3 keeps the V2 adjustment (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%). Quantitative evidence from this segment does not indicate unusually high cost-consciousness or switching activity (utility outgoings are typical, and sporting event attendance is moderate), so no upward demographic calibration is warranted. Therefore, the V3 template for this specific item is applied as instructed. Confidence is high due to direct template match and lack of strong segment-specific modifiers.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement about the perceived value of switching utilities suppliers. The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', likely older, stable, and less transient, which typically correlates with lower enthusiasm for switching (higher inertia). Quantitative evidence does not directly address switching, but high outgoings on utilities suggest some awareness of costs, though not necessarily action. V3 baseline for 'behavior (high friction)' is SA 6%, A 20%, N 26%, D 26%, SD 22%. However, this is an attitude, not a behavior, so the attitude template (SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%) is the starting point. For this segment, inertia and age suggest slightly lower agreement, so I use the V3 template for 'Switching utilities worth effort' (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%), which matches the evidence and segment profile. Confidence is high due to strong segment fit and direct V3 template guidance.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V3 baseline for attitudes is used: SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. However, for this semi-rural, mature segment, the quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting some awareness of costs), but the sporting events and places of worship attendance rates are low, indicating a less urban, less transient, and possibly less price-sensitive or less engaged population. There is no direct evidence of high switching behavior or strong cost-minimization attitudes. V2's template for this item is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%, which is supported by the lack of strong evidence for high agreement. Therefore, the V3 estimate retains the V2 adjustment, as per the system prompt, since V2 performed well for this item. The distribution reflects moderate skepticism and inertia typical for this segment regarding switching utilities.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude item for a semi-rural, mature segment. Quantitative evidence is limited but shows moderate engagement with practical, routine outgoings (high council tax/utilities spend), but low engagement with change-oriented or out-of-home activities (low sporting events/places of worship attendance). V3 baseline for 'Switching utilities worth effort' is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. No evidence suggests this group is especially proactive or especially disengaged with switching, so the base template is appropriate. No demographic calibration is needed (semi-rural maturity is not strongly high/low income or age-skewed enough to warrant adjustment). Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is well justified. The topline quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for routine categories (alcoholic drinks, pet care), which supports the inference of a moderate-to-high cash preference for everyday transactions in the 'Semi-Rural Maturity' segment. The higher online rates for infrequent, high-value purchases (home appliances, holidays) do not contradict this, as they are consistent with broader consumer behavior patterns. The +5pp adjustment to the V3 attitude baseline is explicitly linked to both the segment's demographic profile and the evidence of lower digital engagement for routine purchases. The qualitative segment description further supports the adjustment. The rationale is consistently applied across runs, and the confidence is appropriately high given the strong alignment between evidence and estimate. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:

Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For the ACORN 'Semi-Rural Maturity' segment, quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks: 21%, pet care: 23%), but higher for home appliances (52%) and holidays/travel (55%). This suggests a moderate-to-high preference for traditional (offline/cash) transactions for routine purchases, but willingness to use online for larger, less frequent purchases. The V3 template for this attitude, with a slight increase (+5pp) for 'like to use cash' (due to V2 under-prediction and rural/older segment), is appropriate: SA 15%, A 25%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 12%. This reflects a moderate skew toward cash preference, with significant neutrality and a minority preferring not to use cash. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and segment fit.
Run 2: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement ('I like to use cash when making purchases') for the ACORN Semi-Rural Maturity segment. Quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 23%), but higher for larger/less frequent purchases (home appliances 52%, holiday/travel 55%). This suggests a moderate-to-high preference for traditional payment methods (including cash) for routine purchases, but openness to online for bigger items. V3's attitude baseline is 42% agreement (12% SA, 30% A), but for this segment, a slight increase is justified due to rural/mature profile (likely more cash preference than urban/younger). The concept-specific V3 adjustment for 'like to use cash' is +5pp, so the final estimate is: SA 15%, A 25%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 12%. This maintains variance and aligns with both the evidence and V3's calibration.
Run 3: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude statement. For the ACORN 'Semi-Rural Maturity' segment, quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 23%), with higher rates for home appliances (52%) and holidays/travel (55%). This suggests a moderate but not overwhelming preference for traditional (offline/cash) transactions, especially for routine purchases. The V3 template for this attitude, with a slight increase (+5pp) for this concept, is: SA 15%, A 25%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 12%. This aligns with the evidence that this segment is less digitally engaged for routine items, but not universally averse to online or cashless payments. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors and segment fit.
Run 4: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'), so the V3 attitude baseline would be SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. However, V3 guidance for this specific item is to slightly increase agreement by +5pp, due to V2's slight under-prediction and the tendency for older, semi-rural segments to prefer cash. The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 23%), with higher rates for less frequent, higher-value items (home appliances 52%, holiday/travel 55%). This suggests a moderate-to-high preference for cash or in-person transactions for routine purchases in this segment. The qualitative profile ('Semi-Rural Maturity') also supports a higher cash preference. Therefore, the final estimate is: SA 15%, A 25%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 12%. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between quantitative and qualitative evidence and the V3 correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement ('I like to use cash when making purchases') for the ACORN 'Semi-Rural Maturity' segment. Quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 23%), but higher for home appliances (52%) and holidays (55%). This suggests a segment with moderate digital adoption, likely skewing older and more traditional, which aligns with a higher preference for cash than the UK average. V3's attitude baseline is 42% agreement, but for this segment and this item, a +5pp adjustment is warranted (per V3 guardrails) due to the segment's semi-rural, mature profile and lower online penetration for routine purchases. Thus, the estimate is: Strongly agree 15%, Slightly agree 25%, Neither 28%, Slightly disagree 20%, Strongly disagree 12%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and clear demographic fit.
