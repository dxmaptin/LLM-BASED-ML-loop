### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.68
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale for each run correctly notes that the available quantitative toplines (country of birth, account management by phone) are not directly relevant to the attitudinal concept being estimated. The qualitative notes are generic and do not suggest a need for deviation from the V4 baseline. The repeated application of the V4 attitude baseline is methodologically sound in the absence of concept-specific or strongly relevant demographic evidence. Confidence is moderate to high, as the approach is conservative and avoids overfitting to weak or irrelevant signals. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline for attitudes is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction or strong demographic calibration indicated by the provided quantitative or qualitative evidence. The quantitative toplines relate to country of birth and current account management by phone, but these do not directly inform the attitude concept or suggest a need for deviation from the baseline. No anchor distribution is provided. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence for the specific concept.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction required, and the demographic evidence (semi-rural maturity) does not indicate a need for further adjustment. The quantitative evidence provided is not directly relevant to the attitude concept, so the baseline is maintained. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence for this specific concept in this segment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. There is no concept-specific correction indicated, and the quantitative evidence provided is not directly relevant to the attitude concept, nor does it suggest a need for demographic calibration (the values are all very low and not strongly indicative of attitudinal extremes). No qualitative evidence alters the baseline. Therefore, the general V4 attitude template is used. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided is not directly related to the target concept (values are low and pertain to country of birth and account management by phone), so no strong adjustment is warranted. There are no demographic cues indicating a need for calibration. No concept-specific correction is triggered. The qualitative notes are generic and do not suggest deviation from the baseline. Confidence is moderate-high due to the lack of conflicting or strong evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.60 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the V4 baseline template is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The provided quantitative evidence is not directly related to the target concept (values are low and pertain to country of birth and account management by phone), so it does not justify deviation from the baseline. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the general attitude baseline is used. Confidence is moderate due to lack of concept-specific or strongly relevant evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run clearly references the segment-specific quantitative evidence (notably, the very low proportion identifying as environmentalist and low agreement that energy companies don't care about the environment), both of which are directly relevant to the concept being predicted. The adjustment from the V4 baseline is well explained, with agreement rates reduced in line with the segment's lower environmental concern. The distribution across response categories is consistent with the evidence and the logic of the correction is transparent. Confidence is high due to the strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence and the clear, stepwise reasoning in the runs.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 5.40%
  Slightly agree: 15.40%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 32.00%
  Slightly disagree: 27.20%
  Strongly disagree: 20.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude' (moderate spread). V4 baseline for 'environmental sustainability when putting on events' is 8% SA, 22% A, 30% N, 23% D, 17% SD (30% agreement), but this segment shows even lower environmental engagement: only 7% consider themselves environmentalists and just 25% think energy companies don't care about the environment. Both are well below national averages, indicating lower environmental concern. Therefore, agreement should be adjusted downward from the V4 baseline. Quantitative evidence is strong and directly relevant (relevance >0.9). Final estimate: 5% SA, 15% A, 32% N, 28% D, 20% SD (20% agreement), reflecting both the concept-specific correction and the segment's especially low environmental concern.
Run 2: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=14.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=21.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability, for the 'semi-rural maturity' segment. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3. 

However, the segment's own quantitative data shows extremely low self-identification as environmentalist (7%), and only 25% agree that energy companies do not care about the environment (suggesting low environmental concern overall). Both are well below national averages for similar items. This indicates that even the V4 baseline is likely too high for this segment. 

Therefore, I further reduce agreement by ~9pp (from 30% to 21%), distributing the reduction proportionally across both agree categories. The 'neither' and 'disagree' categories are increased accordingly. This results in a distribution that is lower than the already-corrected V4 baseline, justified by direct quantitative evidence. Confidence is high due to the strong, segment-specific quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: This is an attitude item about environmental sustainability in event planning. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% SA, 22% A, 30% N, 23% D, 17% SD (30% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in prior versions. Segment quantitative evidence shows extremely low self-identification as environmentalist (7%) and low trust in energy companies' environmental care (25%), both much lower than national averages. This suggests even lower agreement than the V4 baseline. No qualitative evidence contradicts this. Therefore, I further reduce agreement by ~5pp, shifting more respondents to neutral/disagree. This yields a distribution of 5% SA, 13% A, 32% N, 28% D, 22% SD. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=19.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude' (moderate spread). V4 baseline for 'environmental sustainability when putting on events' is 8% SA, 22% A, 30% N, 23% D, 17% SD (30% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3. Segment quantitative evidence shows very low self-identification as environmentalist (7%) and low trust in energy companies' environmental care (25%), both well below national averages. This suggests even lower agreement than the V4 baseline for this segment. Demographically, 'semi-rural maturity' likely skews older and more traditional, further reducing agreement. Therefore, I reduce both 'strongly agree' and 'slightly agree' by 2-4pp each, shifting more to 'neither' and 'disagree' categories. Final estimate: 6% SA, 18% A, 32% N, 25% D, 19% SD. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence and clear cross-class correction guidance.
Run 5: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=17.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about environmental sustainability at events. V4 baseline for this concept is 8% strongly agree, 22% slightly agree, 30% neither, 23% slightly disagree, 17% strongly disagree (30% agreement). However, the segment's direct quantitative evidence shows very low self-identification as environmentalist (7%) and low trust in energy companies' environmental care (25% agree), both well below national averages. This suggests even lower agreement than the already-reduced V4 baseline. Therefore, I further reduce agreement by 2pp (to 23% total agreement), shifting more respondents into 'neither' and 'disagree' categories. This is justified by the strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence. Confidence is high due to the directness and strength of the evidence.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.83
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run is consistent and well-grounded in the provided evidence. The concept is classified as a well-calibrated item in V4, and the segment ('semi-rural maturity') does not present any evidence that would warrant deviation from the general population baseline. High outgoings on housing/utilities are noted, but this is interpreted as supporting, rather than contradicting, the baseline estimate. The qualitative and quantitative evidence is appropriately referenced, and the decision not to apply demographic calibration is justified. Confidence is high due to the strong alignment with the evidence and the well-calibrated nature of the item.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.00%
  Slightly agree: 40.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 15.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but with a strong behavioral element, and is one of the four well-calibrated concepts in V4 (error <3pp), so the V3 baseline is retained: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. The segment ('semi-rural maturity') shows moderate digital engagement (low chat bot and computer affinity), but nothing in the quantitative or qualitative evidence suggests a deviation from the general population for this item. Outgoings on housing/utilities are high (73.08), which could indicate a greater awareness of energy costs, but this is not strong enough to warrant a demographic calibration. No evidence suggests a lower or higher agreement than baseline. Therefore, the well-calibrated V4 template is used. Confidence is high due to strong evidence hierarchy and alignment with cross-class calibration.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a 'Behavior (Low Friction)' but is treated as a well-calibrated concept in V4 (see prompt: 'Cut down gas/electricity at home' - KEEP V3: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%). The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', which typically includes older, settled households with moderate-to-high concern for household costs and practical attitudes. The quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on housing/utilities (73%), suggesting salience of energy costs. There is no evidence of digital or attitudinal resistance to energy-saving behaviors. The provided qualitative and quantitative context does not indicate a need to adjust the well-calibrated baseline. Therefore, the V4 template for this concept is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence and the well-calibrated nature of this item.
Run 3: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but with a strong behavioral/environmental norm component. V4 baseline for this item is well-calibrated (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%), and there is no evidence of systematic over- or under-prediction for this concept across classes. The segment ('semi-rural maturity') shows high outgoings on housing/utilities (73.08), which may indicate both high exposure to energy costs and a potential motivation to economize. There is no direct quantitative evidence for or against energy-saving attitudes, but the segment's moderate digital engagement and low affinity for chatbots suggest a pragmatic, possibly cost-conscious mindset. Qualitative hints are neutral. Therefore, the general V4 baseline is appropriate, with no need for demographic calibration or further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the well-calibrated baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but specifically relates to a high-salience, low-friction pro-environmental and cost-saving behavior. V4 guidance indicates this item is well-calibrated in the general population (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% = 70% agreement). The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', likely older, home-owning, and cost-conscious (supported by high outgoings on housing/utilities and low digital engagement). No evidence suggests deviation from the general population for this item. Quantitative evidence is not directly on this concept but supports a profile likely to be attentive to household costs. Therefore, the general V4 template is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is classified as a 'Behavior (Low Friction)' but is specifically listed as a well-calibrated concept in V4, so the baseline should be kept at SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', which typically includes older, settled households who are likely to be cost-conscious (supported by high outgoings on utilities: 73.08) and may be motivated to reduce bills. There is no evidence of systematic deviation for this concept in this segment, and no demographic calibration is needed. Quantitative evidence from the segment does not contradict the baseline. Confidence is high due to direct alignment with V4's well-calibrated template and lack of conflicting evidence.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the most relevant quantitative anchor ('Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 38%) but correctly notes that this is broader than the specific concept of 'fuel consumption is the most important feature.' The V4 baseline correction is appropriately applied due to systematic over-prediction in previous versions, and the demographic profile does not warrant further adjustment. The evidence hierarchy is respected, and the confidence is high due to strong cross-class consistency and quantitative alignment. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 25.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude: 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car.' V4 baseline for this concept is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3 and cross-class consistency. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 0.38, which is higher than the V4 baseline agreement (15%), but this anchor is broader (environmental concern, not just fuel consumption) and does not specify 'most important feature.' Other evidence (energy companies/environment, insurance, online research) is less directly relevant. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, with no upward adjustment, as the anchor is not a direct match and the V4 correction is designed to avoid over-prediction. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class consistency and quantitative evidence alignment.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' item, but the specific focus ('fuel consumption is the most important feature') is a high-friction, cost-sensitive value statement, and V4 guidance treats this as a concept with historically low agreement. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 38%, but this is broader and more positive than 'fuel consumption is the most important feature', which is more restrictive. V4's cross-class analysis shows that for this concept, agreement is systematically over-predicted, so the corrected baseline is 15% agreement (SA 3%, A 12%). The segment's semi-rural, mature profile does not warrant a demographic calibration (no strong evidence for higher/lower agreement). The rest of the evidence (attitudes to energy companies, insurance, online research) is not directly relevant. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchor and V4 cross-class correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the V4 prompt specifies a concept-specific correction: for this item, V3 over-predicted by +5pp, so the V4 baseline is SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 0.38 (38%), which is higher than the V4 baseline, but this is a broader environmental concern, not specifically fuel consumption as the most important feature. The other evidence ('energy companies do not care about the environment', 'well insured', 'researched pet care') is less directly relevant. The demographic (semi-rural maturity) does not trigger a strong calibration (no evidence of high or low income, nor strong age effect), so the V4 baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong concept-specific calibration and relevant quantitative anchor.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement about fuel consumption being the most important feature when buying a new car. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 38%, which is a related but not identical concept (environmental concern vs. fuel economy). V4 guidance for this concept is to use the corrected baseline for 'fuel consumption important when buying car': SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement), reflecting systematic over-prediction in V3. The segment (semi-rural maturity) does not indicate a strong deviation from the general population for this attitude, and no demographic calibration is warranted. The evidence hierarchy is led by the quantitative anchor (0.38), which is higher than the V4 baseline, but since the anchor is for environmental friendliness (not strictly fuel economy), and the V4 correction is based on systematic over-prediction, the V4 baseline is retained. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and clear V4 correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the V4 prompt specifies a concept-specific correction: for 'Fuel consumption important when buying car', reduce by -5pp from the V3 high-friction behavior baseline. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the action topline: 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low co2 emissions' (value=0.38), which is higher than the V4 baseline (0.15 agreement), but this is for environmental friendliness, not specifically fuel consumption, and is still below 0.40. The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', which does not trigger a strong demographic calibration (no evidence of high/low income or age extremes). The V4 template for this concept is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 28%, D 32%, SD 25% (15% agreement). The evidence supports this calibration: the topline for environmental friendliness is higher, but not overwhelmingly so, and the insurance attitude is even lower (0.12). Therefore, the V4 concept-specific baseline is appropriate, with no demographic adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and direct concept-specific correction.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified. The rationale in each run correctly identifies that the concept is a well-calibrated attitude item in V4, and the quantitative evidence from the segment (low risk-taking, low community engagement, moderate climate concern) supports the use of the general population baseline. There is no direct evidence suggesting this segment is more or less debt-averse than average, and the segment's characteristics (semi-rural, mature, cautious) align with the baseline. The repeated application of the V4 template is methodologically sound, and confidence is high due to the lack of contradictory evidence and the well-calibrated nature of the item. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude item. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the baseline: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence from this segment shows low levels of strong pro-social or risk-taking attitudes (e.g., only 9% help out in the community, 18% are risk-tolerant), which aligns with a cautious, debt-averse profile. There is no direct evidence to suggest a deviation from the baseline, and the demographic (semi-rural maturity) is not flagged for strong calibration. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment characteristics and the general population baseline for this concept.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), and the V4 baseline for this item is well-calibrated (43% agreement: 18% SA, 25% A). The segment 'semi-rural maturity' shows low risk-taking (0.18), low community engagement (0.09), and moderate concern for climate change (0.22), all suggesting a cautious, risk-averse profile. This supports the baseline or possibly a slight upward calibration, but V4 guidance is to keep the well-calibrated template unchanged. No direct evidence suggests a major deviation from the general population. Therefore, I use the V4 baseline for this attitude, with moderate-high confidence due to the alignment of segment characteristics with the item.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), which in V4 is well-calibrated and should use the standard template: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence for this segment shows low agreement with risk-taking (0.18) and low community engagement (0.09), suggesting a cautious, possibly conservative profile, but not strongly so. There is no direct evidence about debt aversion, but nothing in the evidence suggests this segment is less debt-averse than the general population. Therefore, the general V4 attitude template for this item is appropriate. Confidence is high due to the well-calibrated nature of this concept and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude item, and per V4, this is a well-calibrated concept (V3 error: -0.2pp), so the baseline template is retained: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence for this segment shows relatively low agreement with strong pro-social or risk-averse attitudes (e.g., only 9% help out in the community, 22% see climate change as the biggest threat, 18% don't mind taking risks with money). However, none of these directly contradict the baseline for debt aversion, and there is no evidence suggesting this segment is unusually tolerant of debt. Therefore, the general population baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to the direct match with a well-calibrated template and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I don't like the idea of being in debt'), which in V4 is well-calibrated and does not require correction from the baseline template. The segment (semi-rural maturity) shows low levels of risk-taking (0.18) and low community engagement (0.09), both of which suggest a cautious, conservative profile. However, there is no direct quantitative evidence about debt aversion, so the general population baseline for this attitude is most appropriate. The V4 template for this concept is: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. No demographic calibration is applied, as the evidence does not indicate a strong deviation from the baseline. Confidence is high due to the well-calibrated nature of this concept and the alignment of segment characteristics with the general population.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.80
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V4 baseline for the identity statement 'I am very good at managing money,' which is already corrected for systematic over-prediction. The quantitative evidence (moderate digital engagement, high car ownership, moderate outgoings, low crime worry) supports the view that this segment is stable and self-reliant, but not exceptionally affluent or deprived. There is no evidence suggesting the need for further demographic calibration or deviation from the V4 baseline. The confidence is high due to the strong fit between the segment profile and the baseline, and the absence of contradictory evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 34.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is classified as an identity statement. The V4 baseline for this item is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), which is already adjusted down by -6pp from V3 to correct for systematic over-prediction. The quantitative evidence does not indicate either unusually high or low financial self-efficacy: 31% manage savings online (moderate digital engagement), and the segment is semi-rural, mature, and has high private car ownership (suggesting moderate affluence and stability). There is no evidence to suggest a need for further demographic calibration (e.g., no strong indicators of high/low income or age extremes). Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied directly, with high confidence due to the well-calibrated nature of this concept and the lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. According to V4, the baseline for this concept is: SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9% (59% agreement), which already incorporates a -6pp correction from V3 due to moderate over-prediction. The segment, 'Semi-Rural Maturity,' shows moderate digital engagement (31% manage savings online), high car ownership (90%), and low crime worry, suggesting financial stability and self-sufficiency typical of this demographic. No evidence suggests deviation from the V4 baseline. Quantitative evidence is not directly about self-perceived money management skill, but the indicators (stable, mature, self-reliant) support the baseline. Therefore, the V4 corrected identity template is applied without further adjustment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. V4 guidance for this is 22% strongly agree, 35% slightly agree, 18% neither, 15% slightly disagree, 10% strongly disagree (57% agreement). However, the segment 'Semi-Rural Maturity' is likely to skew slightly higher: this group is older, more settled, and has high rates of private car ownership (0.90), moderate online banking (0.31), and spends a moderate amount on miscellaneous goods/services. There is no direct quantitative evidence on self-perceived money management, but the demographic profile suggests above-average financial confidence. V4's moderate correction for this concept is -6pp from V3, so the base is 25/34/20/12/9 (59% agreement). No further demographic calibration is applied, as this segment is not especially affluent or deprived. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong demographic fit but lack of direct attitudinal data.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'identity' (self-assessment of money management skill). V4 baseline for 'good at managing money' is 25% SA, 34% A, 20% N, 12% D, 9% SD (59% agreement), reflecting a moderate correction from V3 due to systematic over-prediction. Quantitative evidence is limited but not contradictory: 31% manage savings online (suggests moderate digital engagement), and high car ownership (90%) implies financial stability, but not necessarily high self-rated skill. No direct evidence to justify deviation from V4 baseline. Demographic calibration for 'Semi-Rural Maturity' is not strong enough to warrant adjustment (no high-income or age-specific modifier). Therefore, use the corrected V4 identity template for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=34.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept 'I am very good at managing money' is an identity statement. V4 baseline for this is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, the segment (Semi-Rural Maturity) shows moderate digital engagement (31% manage savings online), high car ownership (90%), and low crime worry (2%), suggesting financial stability and confidence. No direct evidence of exceptional financial self-assessment, but nothing to suggest lower-than-average confidence either. The V4 correction for this concept is -6pp from V3, so the baseline is SA 25%, A 34%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 9%. No demographic calibration is needed (segment is not notably affluent or deprived). Quantitative evidence is moderate, so I retain the V4 baseline for identity. Confidence is moderate-high due to alignment with segment profile and well-calibrated V4 baseline.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.98
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale in each run correctly identifies that the concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline. The quantitative toplines provided (notably the low importance placed on fuel consumption as a car feature) do not indicate a segment-specific deviation in attitudes toward insurance, supporting the use of the general population baseline. The absence of qualitative evidence suggesting higher or lower insurance prioritization further supports this approach. The evidence selection is appropriate, and the confidence in the estimate is high due to strong alignment with both the template guidance and the available segment evidence.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is an attitude item. According to the V4 prompt, this concept is among those that are well-calibrated in V3 and should be left unchanged. The baseline for this item is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The segment (semi-rural maturity) shows no evidence of unusually high or low insurance prioritization in the provided quantitative toplines. The most relevant quantitative evidence (fuel consumption as most important car feature at 15%) suggests a pragmatic, cost-conscious attitude, which aligns with the general population baseline for this item. No demographic calibration is warranted, as there is no evidence of higher insurance prioritization in this segment. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied directly, with high confidence due to strong quantitative alignment and the concept being well-calibrated in prior rounds.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything' (attitude). V4 guidance says this concept is well-calibrated in V3, so we keep the baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The segment (semi-rural maturity) shows low agreement with 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.15), suggesting a pragmatic, not highly risk-averse, attitude. No evidence suggests higher or lower agreement than the general population. No demographic calibration is needed. Quantitative evidence is prioritized, and the V4 template is applied as instructed.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'It is important to be well insured for everything' (attitude). V4 guidance says this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The segment (semi-rural maturity) shows low agreement with 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (0.15), suggesting a tendency to deprioritize practical/financial caution, which aligns with the low baseline for insurance importance. No evidence suggests this segment is more risk-averse or insurance-focused than average. No demographic calibration is needed. Quantitative evidence is prioritized, and the V4 template is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with both the template and segment evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'It is important to be well insured for everything' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. The segment (semi-rural maturity) shows no strong deviation in the provided quantitative evidence (e.g., fuel consumption as most important feature is low at 15%, suggesting a pragmatic, not highly risk-averse or security-focused, profile). No qualitative evidence suggests a higher or lower insurance focus. Therefore, the general population baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct alignment with well-calibrated V3 data and lack of segment-specific deviation.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is an attitude item. According to the V4 prompt, this specific concept is classified as 'well-calibrated' and should use the V3 baseline: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence from the segment (fuel consumption importance at 15%) is low, suggesting a pragmatic, cost-conscious audience, which aligns with the low agreement baseline for insurance importance. No qualitative evidence suggests a higher or lower value for insurance. No demographic calibration is needed, as the segment is not flagged as high/low income or age-skewed. Therefore, the V3 baseline is appropriate and supported by the evidence.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes in the semi-rural maturity segment is well justified. The topline quantitative data clearly show a strong majority are meat-eaters (77%), with very low vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) rates, and moderate pescatarian/flexitarian (17%). This supports the rationale that healthy eating, as defined by plant-based or restrictive diets, is not a dominant behavioral norm in this group. The V4 correction for systematic over-prediction is appropriately applied, and the lack of demographic up-adjustment is justified by the segment's characteristics. The repeated rationales consistently reference the quantitative evidence and the V4 correction, and the confidence is high due to strong alignment between the evidence and the estimate. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 26.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 14.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3) across all demographics, so the baseline is set at 38% agreement (SA+A). The quantitative evidence shows this segment is overwhelmingly meat-eating (77%), with very low vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) rates, and moderate pescatarian/flexitarian (17%). This suggests a traditional, less health-focused eating pattern, but the concept is about attitude, not behavior. There is no direct attitude data, so the V4 corrected baseline is appropriate, with no upward demographic calibration (semi-rural maturity is not a high-health-attitude group). The distribution is thus: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14%. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class evidence and quantitative support for low prevalence of health-motivated eating.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is now 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). Quantitative evidence shows this segment is overwhelmingly meat-eating (77%), with very low vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) rates, and moderate pescatarian/flexitarian (17%). This suggests a traditional diet, likely less focus on 'healthy eating' as defined by plant-based or restrictive diets, but not necessarily outright rejection. The V4 baseline is already conservative and fits this profile. No demographic up-adjustment is warranted (semi-rural, mature, not especially affluent or deprived). Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and V4's cross-class correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an 'attitude' item ('Healthy Eating') for the 'semi-rural maturity' segment. V4 mandates a major correction for 'Healthy Eating' due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3), so the baseline is now 38% agreement (SA 12%, A 26%). The quantitative evidence shows a strong majority eat meat (77%), with very low vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) rates, and moderate pescatarian/flexitarian/other (17%). This suggests that while some may value healthy eating, actual dietary choices skew traditional and less restrictive, supporting the lower agreement baseline. No evidence suggests this segment is more health-focused than average, so no upward demographic calibration is warranted. The distribution is thus set at the V4 corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and robust cross-class correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a major correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction (+21.6pp in V3 across all classes). The corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is: SA 12%, A 26%, N 26%, D 22%, SD 14% (38% agreement). Quantitative evidence shows this segment is overwhelmingly meat-eating (77%), with very low vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) rates, and moderate pescatarian/flexitarian (17%). This suggests a traditional diet, likely less health-focused than average, but the V4 baseline already incorporates a strong downward correction for all classes. No further downward demographic calibration is needed, as the segment is not flagged as especially health-oriented. Therefore, the V4 corrected baseline is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence and the cross-class correction.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=26.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=14.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude). V4 mandates a -22pp correction for this concept due to systematic over-prediction in all classes. The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', which is not a high-variance outlier and does not warrant demographic calibration. Quantitative evidence shows a strong majority (77%) eat meat, with very low vegan (1%) and vegetarian (4%) rates, and a moderate pescatarian/flexitarian/other (17%). This suggests healthy eating is not a dominant behavioral norm, supporting a lower agreement rate. The V4 corrected baseline for 'Healthy Eating' is 12% strongly agree, 26% slightly agree, 26% neither, 22% slightly disagree, 14% strongly disagree (38% agreement). This is consistent with both the quantitative evidence and the V4 cross-class correction. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and robust V4 correction.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run consistently references the V4 baseline for the 'Retirement is your responsibility' concept, which is appropriate given the identity/attitude nature of the statement and the segment's characteristics. The quantitative evidence provided (low alternative investment planning, moderate saving for a purpose, moderate trust in financial tools) does not contradict the baseline, and there is no strong demographic or attitudinal evidence to warrant deviation from the template. The confidence is high due to the strong fit between the template and the segment, and the lack of contradictory or strongly directional evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 25.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.00%
  Slightly disagree: 13.00%
  Strongly disagree: 9.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'identity' type statement (about personal responsibility for retirement), so the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is used: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this semi-rural maturity segment shows low alternative retirement planning (14% plan to use other investments), moderate saving for specific purposes (28%), and moderate trust in financial tools (51%). These do not suggest a major deviation from the general population for this attitude. No strong demographic calibration is warranted (semi-rural, mature, not strongly affluent or deprived). The V4 template for this concept is already corrected for previous over-prediction. Therefore, the baseline is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong template fit and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but closely aligns with identity for this segment (semi-rural, mature), who are likely to value self-reliance. The V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is 60% agreement (25% SA, 35% A), reflecting a moderate correction from V3. Quantitative evidence is limited but relevant: only 14% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting low proactive planning), but this does not directly contradict a sense of responsibility—just that action may lag attitude. The other financial attitudes (saving for a purpose, trust in comparison sites, switching utilities) are not directly related but suggest moderate engagement with financial planning (28–51% agreement). No evidence suggests this segment is less likely than average to agree with the statement. Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied without further adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong cross-class calibration and moderate supporting evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but closely aligns with identity for older, semi-rural, mature segments. V4 guidance for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is to use 25/35/18/13/9 (60% agreement), which is a moderate correction from V3 due to mild over-prediction. Quantitative evidence is limited but does not contradict this: only 14% plan to use other investments for retirement (suggesting most expect to rely on pensions or state support), but this does not directly measure perceived responsibility. The segment's moderate trust in financial comparison sites (51%) and moderate agreement that switching utilities is worth the effort (33%) suggest a pragmatic, somewhat self-reliant attitude, but not strongly so. Therefore, the V4 template is appropriate, with no further demographic calibration needed. Confidence is high due to direct V4 template match and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an 'attitude' but with some identity overlap (personal responsibility for retirement). V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is 25/35/18/13/9 (60% agreement), reflecting a moderate consensus but not universal agreement. The segment (semi-rural maturity) is likely to have a slightly higher sense of personal responsibility than average, but the quantitative evidence (e.g., only 14% plan to use other investments for retirement, 28% only save for a specific purpose) suggests a moderate, not high, level of proactive financial planning. No evidence suggests a need to adjust the V4 baseline. Therefore, the V4 template for this concept is applied directly. Confidence is high due to strong template calibration and relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=25.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility'), so the V4 baseline for 'Retirement is your responsibility' is used: SA 25%, A 35%, N 18%, D 13%, SD 9% (60% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this semi-rural maturity segment shows low intent to use other investments for retirement (14%), moderate agreement with saving for a specific purpose (28%), and moderate trust in price comparison sites (51%). The most relevant anchor is the V4 template, as none of the provided quantitative items directly measure the attitude of personal responsibility for retirement, but the low alternative investment intent suggests a moderate, not high, sense of personal agency. No strong demographic calibration is needed (segment is not especially affluent or deprived). Therefore, the V4 baseline is applied with high confidence, as it is well-calibrated for this concept and segment.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.81
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. All runs consistently apply the V4 baseline for the attitude 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort,' and the rationales clearly explain why no demographic calibration is warranted. The quantitative evidence (high outgoings on utilities) is acknowledged but correctly interpreted as not indicating unusually high or low switching propensity. There is no qualitative evidence suggesting deviation from the baseline. The evidence selection rationale confirms that both quantitative and qualitative context were considered. The confidence is high due to strong alignment with the V4 baseline and lack of contradictory evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude (not high friction behavior), so the V4 baseline for 'Switching utilities worth effort' is used: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows this segment is engaged with council tax/utilities (high outgoings), but there is no evidence of unusually high switching or dissatisfaction, nor of disengagement. The segment's semi-rural, mature profile may slightly reduce switching propensity due to inertia or satisfaction with current suppliers, but V4 guidance says this concept is already well-calibrated and should not be adjusted. No demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment with V4 baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' is classified as an attitude. According to V4, this concept is well-calibrated and should use the V3 baseline: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. The provided segment (semi-rural maturity) shows moderate engagement with practical outgoings (high council tax/utilities spend), but no evidence of unusually high or low switching behavior or attitudes. Quantitative evidence is neutral, and there is no qualitative evidence suggesting deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the general attitude baseline is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with the evidence hierarchy and the well-calibrated status of this concept in V4.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 baseline for this is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. There is no strong evidence in the provided quantitative or qualitative data to suggest this segment is more or less likely to agree than the general population. The segment's outgoings on utilities are typical, and there is no indication of unusually high engagement with switching or cost sensitivity. Therefore, the general V4 template is applied without demographic calibration. Confidence is high due to direct alignment with the well-calibrated V4 baseline and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort'), so the V4 baseline for attitudes is used: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, segment context (semi-rural, mature) suggests moderate inertia and possibly less enthusiasm for switching, but not dramatically so. Quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (council tax, utilities, water, etc.), which could slightly increase agreement, but the effect is likely modest due to age/inertia. No evidence of strong pro-switching sentiment. Therefore, I keep the V4 attitude baseline with a slight nudge toward more neutrality/disagreement (N +2pp, D +5pp, A -5pp, SA -2pp), reflecting likely moderate skepticism or inertia in this segment. This matches the V4 template for this concept, which is well-calibrated. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative context and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude (not high friction behavior), so the V4 baseline for this item is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement). This matches the 'Switching utilities worth effort' template, which is well-calibrated and should not be adjusted per V4 rules. The segment is 'semi-rural maturity', which does not trigger any strong demographic calibration (no evidence of high/low income, age, or urban/rural extremes that would shift the baseline). Quantitative evidence about outgoings (utilities, council tax, etc.) is present, but does not indicate unusually high or low engagement with switching. Therefore, the general population baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to direct template match and lack of conflicting evidence.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the quantitative toplines, which show low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks and pet care), suggesting a moderate preference for traditional payment methods such as cash. The higher online rates for infrequent, high-value purchases (appliances, holidays) are correctly interpreted as evidence of selective digital adoption, not a general digital orientation. The qualitative profile (Semi-Rural Maturity) is appropriately considered, and the V4 baseline is shown to already incorporate demographic tendencies, with demographic corrections now halved. The decision to use the V4 baseline is well-supported by both the quantitative and qualitative evidence, and the confidence level is appropriate given the strong alignment. No further adjustment is warranted.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 13.00%
  Slightly agree: 24.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 22.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For 'Semi-Rural Maturity', the quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 23%), with higher rates for larger/less frequent purchases (home appliances 52%, holidays 55%). This suggests a moderate preference for traditional payment methods, including cash, for routine purchases. The V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is 13/24/28/22/13 (37% agreement), which fits well given the segment's likely age profile (older, more rural, more traditional). No strong evidence to adjust up or down, so the V4 baseline is appropriate. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and segment fit.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is 'attitude' (preference for cash). V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is 13/24/28/22/13 (37% agreement), reflecting moderate agreement and a wide spread. Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcohol 21%, pet care 23%), suggesting this segment is less digitally oriented and more likely to prefer cash than the UK average. However, for higher-value items (appliances 52%, travel 55%), online use is higher, indicating some digital adoption. The qualitative profile ('Semi-Rural Maturity') typically skews older and more traditional, which aligns with a slight upward adjustment in cash preference, but V4 demographic calibrations are now halved and the concept-specific correction is low (+0-2pp at most). Therefore, the V4 baseline is appropriate, with no strong evidence to deviate. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and well-calibrated V4 baseline.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For the 'Semi-Rural Maturity' segment, the quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 23%), with higher rates for less frequent, higher-value items (home appliances 52%, holidays 55%). This suggests a preference for traditional payment methods (like cash) for routine purchases, but willingness to use digital for larger or less frequent ones. The V4 baseline for 'like to use cash' is 13% strongly agree, 24% slightly agree, 28% neither, 22% slightly disagree, 13% strongly disagree (37% agreement). No strong demographic correction is warranted, as semi-rural, older, and less digitally engaged segments tend to be closer to the baseline or slightly higher, but the evidence here does not justify a significant upward adjustment. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative anchors and well-calibrated baseline.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). For V4, the general baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting moderate agreement and a broad spread. Quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 23%), with higher rates for appliances and travel (52-55%). This suggests that the segment is less digitally oriented for routine purchases, which aligns with a higher preference for cash than the UK average. However, the V4 template already incorporates this tendency, and demographic calibration for this class (older, semi-rural) would only slightly increase agreement, but V4 reduces demographic adjustments by 50%. Therefore, the baseline V4 distribution is appropriate, with no further upward adjustment. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and well-calibrated V4 template.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=24.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I like to use cash when making purchases' is an attitude item. For V4, the general baseline for this concept is: SA 13%, A 24%, N 28%, D 22%, SD 13% (37% agreement), reflecting a moderate spread and correcting for V3's slight over-prediction. The quantitative evidence shows relatively low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 21%, pet care 23%), and higher for less frequent, higher-value items (home appliances 52%, holiday/travel 55%). This suggests that the segment (Semi-Rural Maturity) is less digitally engaged for routine purchases, which aligns with a higher preference for cash than the UK average. However, the V4 correction already accounts for this, and the evidence does not justify a further upward demographic calibration (which is now reduced by 50% in V4). Therefore, I use the V4 baseline for this concept. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and the appropriateness of the V4 template for this segment and item type.
