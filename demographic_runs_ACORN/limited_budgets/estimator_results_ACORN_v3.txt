### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.69
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale for each run correctly identifies that the available quantitative evidence is only weakly relevant (low values, not directly about the target attitude concept) and that there are no strong qualitative or demographic cues to warrant deviation from the V3 attitude baseline. The repeated application of the baseline is appropriate in the absence of direct or strongly relevant evidence. The confidence level is appropriately described as moderate. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 30.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 27.00%
  Slightly disagree: 18.00%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' statement, so the V3 attitude baseline is applied: SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. The available quantitative evidence is only weakly relevant (all values <0.13, and not directly about the target concept), so it does not justify a major adjustment. There are no strong demographic calibrations or concept-specific corrections indicated. The qualitative notes are generic and do not suggest a shift. Therefore, the balanced V3 attitude template is used. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' statement, for which the V3 baseline is SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. The quantitative evidence provided is only weakly relevant (all values <0.13, and not directly about the target concept), so it does not justify deviation from the baseline. There are no strong qualitative cues or demographic calibrations that would shift the estimate. Therefore, the balanced V3 attitude template is applied. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' statement, for which the V3 baseline is SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. There is no strong quantitative evidence to shift the baseline: the retrieved values (e.g., 'Manage current account by phone' at 12%, 'Arrange by phone' at 3%) are low and relate to specific behaviors, not general attitudes. Demographic calibrations are not triggered (no strong evidence of high/low income, age, etc.). No concept-specific correction applies. Therefore, the balanced V3 attitude template is used. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct quantitative anchors.
Run 4: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' statement, so the V3 attitude baseline is used: SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. The quantitative evidence provided is only weakly relevant (all values are low, 0.02-0.12, and pertain to behaviors like managing accounts by phone or country of birth, not directly to the attitude concept). No strong demographic calibration is indicated. There is no concept-specific correction for this generic 'Concept' item. Therefore, the balanced V3 attitude template is applied. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct quantitative anchors and only generic qualitative context.
Run 5: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is classified as an 'attitude' statement, so the V3 attitude baseline is used: SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. The quantitative evidence provided is only weakly relevant (all values are low, <0.13, and pertain to behaviors like managing accounts by phone or country of birth, not directly to the attitude concept). No strong demographic or concept-specific corrections apply. There is no evidence to suggest this segment is more or less likely to agree than the general population. Therefore, the balanced V3 attitude template is applied. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.

### Concept: I think brands should consider environmental sustainability when putting on events
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative evidence: very low self-identification as environmentalists (9%) and moderate skepticism toward energy companies (27%). The use of the V3 template with a +10pp correction is transparently explained as a response to prior under-prediction, and the resulting agreement (45%) is appropriately higher than the direct 'environmentalist' self-ID but still reflects the segment's low engagement. The evidence hierarchy is respected, with quantitative data dominating the adjustment, and the absence of qualitative context is correctly noted as a reason not to further increase agreement. The repeated convergence on the same distribution across multiple runs further supports the robustness of the estimate. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 14.60%
  Slightly agree: 29.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 18.00%
  Strongly disagree: 10.40%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (9%) and 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' (27%), both showing low to moderate environmental concern in this segment (limited budgets). The V3 template for this specific concept ('environmental sustainability when putting on events') calls for a slight increase over the generic attitude baseline, due to prior under-prediction (-10pp in V2). Therefore, the adjusted V3 distribution is SA 15%, A 30%, N 28%, D 17%, SD 10% (45% agreement). This is slightly higher than the direct evidence would suggest, but justified by the V3 correction and the need to avoid systematic under-prediction. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and clear concept classification.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement for the 'limited budgets' segment. The most relevant quantitative evidence is very low environmental self-identification (9% agree they are environmentalists) and low trust in energy companies (27% agree they don't care about the environment). The V3 attitude baseline is SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. However, given the extremely low environmentalist self-ID and the segment's likely focus on cost over values, I have adjusted the agreement downward by about 7pp (SA/A combined 38% vs. V3 base 42%). This is still higher than the direct 'environmentalist' self-ID, as the question is about what brands should do (a less personal, more aspirational attitude), but the overall agreement is muted by the segment's priorities. The distribution maintains V3's variance and is consistent with the evidence hierarchy, with direct quant data (9%/27%) dominating the adjustment.
Run 3: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement for the 'limited budgets' segment. Direct quantitative evidence shows only 9% consider themselves environmentalists and 27% think energy companies do not care about the environment, both indicating low environmental engagement. The V3 template for this concept (attitude, with concept-specific +10pp correction) is: SA 15%, A 30%, N 28%, D 17%, SD 10% (45% agreement). The quantitative evidence supports a lower-than-average agreement, but the V3 correction ensures we do not under-predict. No evidence suggests this segment is more pro-environmental than average, so no upward demographic calibration is applied. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and direct concept-specific correction.
Run 4: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement. The most directly relevant quantitative evidence is 'I consider myself an environmentalist' (9%), which is extremely low for this segment, and 'I think energy companies do not care about the environment' (27%), which suggests some skepticism but not strong pro-environmental sentiment. The V3 template for this concept (attitude, with a +10pp correction for this specific item) is SA 15%, A 30%, N 28%, D 17%, SD 10% (45% agreement). This matches the evidence: the segment is not strongly pro-environmental, but there is a moderate minority who care. The qualitative context is missing, but the quantitative evidence is strong and overrides. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative alignment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=30.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the very low proportion (9%) who consider themselves environmentalists in this segment, and a moderate 27% who think energy companies do not care about the environment. This suggests low personal environmental identity but some skepticism toward companies. The V3 template for this concept ("environmental sustainability when putting on events") recommends a slight increase over V2 due to prior under-prediction, with a base of SA 15%, A 30%, N 28%, D 17%, SD 10% (45% agreement). Given the segment's low environmental self-identification, I do not increase agreement further. The evidence hierarchy is dominated by direct quant data (80% weight), which supports a cautious estimate. The qualitative context is missing, so no upward adjustment is warranted. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.

### Concept: Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V3 guidance for this specific attitude item, which mandates a +13pp correction due to universal cost-consciousness, especially in segments with high utility outgoings. The quantitative evidence (76.64% outgoings on housing/utilities) strongly supports the segment's motivation to economize, and the absence of contradictory evidence from other attitudes or digital engagement is correctly noted as irrelevant. The repeated application of the V3 template (SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%) is methodologically sound given the evidence and guidance. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.00%
  Slightly agree: 40.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 15.00%
  Slightly disagree: 10.00%
  Strongly disagree: 5.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home'), but V3 guidance specifies a concept-specific correction: cost-consciousness is universal and this item is systematically under-predicted, so the base agreement is increased by +13pp. The segment ('limited budgets') is highly cost-sensitive, as evidenced by the very high outgoings on housing/utilities (76.64%) and the segment's likely focus on economizing. There is no direct quantitative topline for this exact item, but the context and V3 rules support a high agreement estimate. The distribution is thus: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment characteristics and the concept-specific correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home'), but V3 guidance specifies a concept-specific correction: this item is universally cost-conscious and should be increased by +13pp over the attitude baseline. The segment ('limited budgets') is highly cost-sensitive, as evidenced by the very high outgoings on housing/utilities (76.64%) and the segment's likely financial constraints. Quantitative evidence for similar cost-saving attitudes is not directly available, but the context and V3 rules justify using the highest agreement template: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5%. This reflects both the universal and segment-specific tendency to economize on utilities. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment characteristics and the concept-specific correction.
Run 3: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an 'attitude' item with a strong behavioral element (cost-consciousness about utilities). V3 guidance specifies that for 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas/electricity at home', the base should be increased by +13pp over V2, due to universal cost-consciousness, especially in segments with limited budgets. The quantitative evidence shows extremely high outgoings on housing/utilities (76.6%), which supports a high level of agreement with this statement. There is no evidence of strong digital engagement or local business support, but these are less relevant. No direct anchor for this exact item, but the segment's financial constraints further support the high agreement. Therefore, the distribution is: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement), matching the V3 concept-specific correction for this item.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude ('Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home'), but V3 guidance specifies a concept-specific correction: this item is universally high across demographics and should be increased by +13pp over the standard attitude baseline. The base for attitudes is SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%, but for this item, V3 recommends SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). Quantitative evidence from the segment shows extremely high outgoings on housing, water, electricity, gas, etc. (76.6%), which supports a strong motivation to economize. There is no evidence of digital or financial attitudes that would reduce this tendency. Therefore, the concept-specific correction is applied directly, with high confidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=15.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=5.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is 'Make an effort to cut down on the use of gas / electricity at home', which is an attitude with a strong behavioral component, especially for the 'limited budgets' segment. V3 guidance specifies a +13pp correction for this item, as cost-consciousness is universal and prior versions under-predicted. The quantitative evidence shows extremely high outgoings on housing and utilities (76.64), indicating strong salience of energy costs. There is no direct quantitative anchor for this exact item, but the context of limited budgets and high utility spend supports a high agreement estimate. Demographic calibration for low income (+8pp) is already reflected in the concept-specific correction. The qualitative notes are not available, but the segment's profile (cost-sensitive, likely to prioritize savings) further supports a high agreement. Therefore, the V3 corrected template is applied: SA 30%, A 40%, N 15%, D 10%, SD 5% (70% agreement). Confidence is high due to strong quantitative and segment fit.

### Concept: Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative anchor ('Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions', value=0.34, relevance=0.98), which is the closest available proxy for fuel consumption salience in this segment. The estimate (20% agreement) is lower than the anchor, appropriately reflecting the more exclusive 'most important' phrasing of the target concept. The repeated use of the V3 template is justified by the evidence and the segment's profile, and the low agreement with other related attitudes (insurance, online research) further supports a skeptical baseline. No evidence suggests a need to increase agreement. The confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors and clear alignment with template guidance. No revision needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 5.00%
  Slightly agree: 15.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 30.00%
  Strongly disagree: 22.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement for the 'limited budgets' segment. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (0.34), which is higher than the typical value for 'fuel consumption' in general population, but still low. The V3 template for this concept (fuel consumption most important) is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22% (20% agreement), which matches the evidence that only a minority prioritize fuel consumption above all else, even in cost-conscious segments. The segment is cost-conscious, but the evidence does not show a majority prioritizing fuel consumption as the single most important feature. The insurance and online research anchors are lower still, supporting a skeptical baseline. No demographic calibration is needed as the V3 template already reflects cost-consciousness. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchors and alignment with V3 guidance.
Run 2: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but the segment is 'limited budgets', which may slightly increase the salience of cost-related features. However, the closest quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.34), which is related but not identical—environmental concern is not the same as fuel cost concern, but there is some overlap. The V3 template for this concept (see prompt) is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22% (20% agreement), which is already calibrated for low agreement and matches the evidence (low quantitative values for related items: 0.34 for environmental, 0.13 for insurance, 0.21 for online research). No evidence suggests a need to increase agreement for this segment, as the values are low and the segment is not strongly environmentally motivated. Therefore, the V3 default for this concept is applied. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and strong template match.
Run 3: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but it is a particularly strong/absolute attitude ("most important"). The closest quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' (value=0.34), which is a related but slightly broader/softer environmental concern. This value (0.34) suggests that only about a third of this segment prioritize environmental factors, which are closely related to fuel consumption. The V3 baseline for attitude is: SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13% (42% agreement). However, the quantitative evidence is lower (0.34), and the 'most important' phrasing is more exclusive, so agreement should be lower than the baseline. V3 guidance for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22% (20% agreement), which matches the evidence and the segment's profile (limited budgets, likely to care about cost but not to the exclusion of all else). The evidence hierarchy is strong (direct quant data, relevance 0.98), so this overrides the generic baseline. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchor and clear V3 guidance.
Run 4: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement for a 'limited budgets' segment. The closest quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 34%, but this is a different (though related) value. The V3 template for 'fuel consumption important when buying car' is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22% (20% agreement), which matches the evidence that cost-conscious segments do not prioritize fuel consumption as the most important feature. The segment's low agreement with 'well insured for everything' (13%) and moderate agreement with environmental attitudes (27%) further support a low agreement estimate. No demographic calibration is needed as the V3 template already reflects the low-income/cost-conscious baseline. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative anchors and strong template alignment.
Run 5: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept is an attitude statement ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car'), but it is a particularly strong and exclusive attitude (most important feature), which typically reduces agreement rates. The closest quantitative anchor is 'Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low CO2 emissions' at 34%, which is higher than the V3 baseline for this concept (20% agreement). However, the segment is 'limited budgets', which may increase the salience of fuel costs, but the provided evidence does not show high agreement with environmental or insurance priorities (0.13 for insurance, 0.27 for energy companies' environmental care). The V3 template for this concept is: SA 5%, A 15%, N 28%, D 30%, SD 22% (20% agreement), which matches the evidence and segment context. No strong evidence suggests increasing agreement above this baseline. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative anchors and alignment with V3 guidance.

### Concept: I don't like the idea of being in debt
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the V3 concept-specific correction, which is validated by prior rounds (V2 error <1pp) and is appropriate for this attitude item. The quantitative evidence (low risk-taking, low community engagement) supports a cautious, risk-averse profile, aligning with moderate-to-high debt aversion but not at the highest levels. Demographic calibration is correctly withheld, as the concept-specific correction already accounts for the segment's characteristics. No evidence contradicts the estimate, and the justification is thorough and consistent across runs. Confidence is high due to strong template alignment and supporting evidence.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 18.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 22.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') is an attitude statement. According to the V3 template, the baseline for attitudes is SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. However, V3 also specifies a concept-specific correction for this item, based on prior validation: 'Don't like being in debt' should use SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. This is because V2's adjustment for this item was highly accurate (error <1pp), and V3 maintains that correction. 

Demographic calibration: The segment is 'limited budgets' (lower income), which would normally warrant a slight increase in agreement (+8pp), but the concept-specific correction already incorporates this, as it was validated on similar segments. 

Quantitative evidence: The segment shows low risk appetite (0.20), low community engagement (0.05), and moderate concern for climate change (0.23), all consistent with risk aversion and financial caution. This supports the use of the concept-specific correction. 

Therefore, the final distribution is: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and validated correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an 'attitude' item, but V3 guidance specifies to use the established template for 'I don't like being in debt' (SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%) as V2's estimate was highly accurate for this concept. Quantitative evidence from this segment shows low risk-taking (0.20), low community engagement (0.05), and moderate concern for climate change (0.23), all suggesting a cautious, risk-averse profile, which aligns with a moderate-to-high aversion to debt. No evidence suggests a need to adjust the template up or down. Confidence is high due to direct template match and supporting evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude statement. According to the V3 template for attitudes, the baseline is SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. However, V3 also includes a concept-specific correction for this item, based on V2's strong performance (error <1pp), so the recommended distribution is SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (43% agreement). 

The quantitative evidence from the segment (ACORN_limited_budgets) shows low agreement for risk-taking with money (0.20), and very low for community helping (0.05), suggesting a cautious, risk-averse profile. This supports the idea that a moderate proportion will dislike debt, but not at the highest levels. No evidence suggests a need to increase or decrease the template values. 

Demographic calibration is not applied here as the evidence does not indicate a strong deviation from the template. Confidence is high due to direct template match and supporting segment evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('I don't like the idea of being in debt') is an attitude statement. According to the V3 template, the base for attitudes is SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. However, the segment ('limited budgets') is likely to be more debt-averse than average, but the quantitative evidence shows relatively low agreement with other pro-social or risk-averse attitudes (e.g., only 0.05 for 'helping out in the community', 0.23 for 'climate change is the biggest threat', and 0.20 for 'I do not mind taking risks with my money'). These suggest a somewhat cautious but not extreme profile. The V3 template for this specific item ('don't like being in debt') is: SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15% (43% agreement), which matches the evidence and is supported by V2's accuracy for this item. No further demographic calibration is needed as the segment is not strongly elderly or low-income. Confidence is high due to direct template match and supporting evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The item 'I don't like the idea of being in debt' is an attitude statement. According to the V3 template, the baseline for attitudes is SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. However, V3 also includes a concept-specific correction for this exact item, based on V2's strong performance (error <1pp), so the recommended distribution is SA 18%, A 25%, N 22%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence from the segment shows low risk-taking (20%) and low community engagement (5%), which supports a moderate-to-high aversion to debt, but not an extreme one. No direct quantitative data for debt aversion is present, so the concept-specific correction is prioritized. Demographic calibration is not applied as the evidence does not indicate a strong deviation from the base. Confidence is high due to the direct match with a V3 template correction.

### Concept: I am very good at managing money
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I am very good at managing money' is sufficiently justified based on the evidence and rationale provided. The repeated application of the V3 identity template with the +24pp correction is appropriate for this self-efficacy item, especially given the lack of direct contradictory quantitative evidence. The available quantitative data (low digital engagement, high private car ownership) does not undermine the high self-perceived money management skills often reported in lower-income groups. The rationale correctly notes that behaviors like online savings management are not direct proxies for self-concept. The confidence is high due to strong template guidance, appropriate segment calibration, and alignment with known patterns in self-reported financial efficacy. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 30.00%

Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' is an IDENTITY item, not just an attitude, and V3 guidance specifically calls for a substantial upward correction (+24pp) from the standard attitude baseline. The segment is 'limited budgets' (likely lower income), which V3 calibrates as +8pp agreement. Quantitative evidence is limited but does not contradict a high self-efficacy: 17% manage savings online (low digital engagement), but 75% privately own their main car (suggests some financial management ability). The qualitative profile is missing, but the V3 template for this concept is: SA 30%, A 35%, N 18%, D 10%, SD 7% (65% agreement). This is applied directly, as the segment is not expected to be dramatically lower than the general population on self-perceived money management (people in lower-income groups often rate their budgeting skills highly, even if absolute resources are limited). Confidence is high due to strong template guidance and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' is an IDENTITY item, not just an attitude, and should use the V3 identity template. V3 corrects for V2's systematic under-prediction of self-efficacy statements like this (+24pp adjustment). The segment (ACORN 'limited budgets') is likely to have higher self-perceived money management skills due to necessity, but the quantitative evidence is limited: only 17% manage savings online (suggesting low digital engagement, not necessarily low self-efficacy), and 75% privately own their main car (suggesting some asset management). No direct quantitative data on self-perceived money management, so the V3 identity template with the +24pp correction is most appropriate. Demographic calibration is not applied as the segment is not explicitly high/low income or age-skewed. Confidence is high due to strong concept-specific correction and alignment with segment characteristics.
Run 3: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' is an IDENTITY item, which V3 treats with a higher baseline agreement (62%) due to strong self-concept. The segment is 'limited budgets' (likely lower income), which V3 calibrates upward (+8pp) for self-efficacy on money management, as lower-income groups often report higher self-perceived money management skills out of necessity. Quantitative evidence is limited but does not contradict this: only 17% manage savings online (suggesting low digital engagement, not necessarily low self-efficacy), and high private car ownership (75%) suggests some financial stability. No direct quantitative evidence contradicts the high self-assessment. Therefore, the V3 concept-specific correction for this item is applied: SA 30%, A 35%, N 18%, D 10%, SD 7%. Confidence is high due to strong evidence hierarchy and alignment with V3 corrections.
Run 4: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' is an IDENTITY concept, not just an attitude, and should use the V3 identity template. For this segment (ACORN: limited budgets), there is no direct quantitative self-efficacy data, but the segment shows high private car ownership (0.75), low online savings management (0.17), and moderate spending on miscellaneous goods/services. These suggest a population that is cost-conscious but may not have high financial sophistication. V3 guidance is to use the identity template (base: 25/37/16/13/9), but for 'good at managing money' specifically, V3 mandates a +24pp correction due to systematic under-prediction in V2. This yields: SA 30%, A 35%, N 18%, D 10%, SD 7%. This is supported by the segment's likely self-reliant attitude (as seen in similar segments), but moderated by evidence of limited digital financial engagement. Confidence is high due to strong template guidance and moderate quantitative support.
Run 5: Strongly agree=30.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=10.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'I am very good at managing money' is best classified as an IDENTITY item, not just an attitude, per V3 guidance. For identity statements, the V3 baseline is 25% strongly agree, 37% slightly agree, 16% neither, 13% slightly disagree, and 9% strongly disagree (62% agreement). However, V3 mandates a +24pp correction for this specific item due to systematic under-prediction in V2 and strong evidence that people over-claim financial self-efficacy. The segment (ACORN 'limited budgets') shows low online savings management (17%), but this is a behavior, not a self-concept, and does not directly contradict high self-perceived money management. No direct quantitative evidence contradicts the high self-rating. Therefore, the concept-specific correction is applied: SA 30%, A 35%, N 18%, D 10%, SD 7% (65% agreement). Confidence is high due to strong V3 evidence hierarchy and the lack of direct contradictory data.

### Concept: It is important to be well insured for everything
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant quantitative anchor ('Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', value=0.16), which is a strong indicator of cost-consciousness and low prioritization of 'responsibility' or 'risk-averse' attitudes in the 'limited budgets' segment. The application of the V3 template for this specific concept is appropriate, as it is supported by both the direct quantitative evidence and prior calibration accuracy (V2 error within +4.5pp). The absence of qualitative context is acknowledged, but the high relevance and alignment of the quantitative evidence compensate for this. No demographic up-weighting is needed, and the evidence hierarchy is respected. The confidence in the estimate is high, and no corrective feedback is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 25.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 28.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is an attitude statement, but V3 guidance treats it as a special case due to prior evidence that insurance is not highly prioritized in 'limited budgets' segments. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.16), which is low and suggests a pragmatic, cost-conscious mindset. The V3 template for this specific item is: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement), which matches the evidence that this segment deprioritizes comprehensive insurance due to budget constraints. No demographic up-weighting is needed, as the segment is already cost-sensitive. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and strong alignment with V3's concept-specific correction.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement ('It is important to be well insured for everything'), but V3 guidance specifies that for this particular concept, the correct baseline is the V2 adjustment: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement). The quantitative evidence from the segment (limited budgets) shows low agreement with other 'responsibility' or 'costly' attitudes (e.g., only 16% agree fuel consumption is most important when buying a car), supporting a low agreement estimate. There is no evidence of higher insurance prioritization in this segment, and the qualitative context is not available. Therefore, the V3 template for this specific item is applied directly, with high confidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is an attitude statement, but V3 guidance specifies to use the concept-specific correction for this item, which is to KEEP the V2 adjustment: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28%. This is because V2's prediction for this item was accurate (within +4.5pp error), and the quantitative evidence for this segment (ACORN Limited Budgets) shows low agreement with similar 'prudent' or 'risk-averse' attitudes (e.g., only 16% agree that fuel consumption is most important when buying a car). The segment is cost-conscious and likely to deprioritize comprehensive insurance due to budget constraints. No demographic calibration is needed, as the segment is already low-income and the template is already conservative. Confidence is high due to direct quantitative evidence and strong alignment with V3's evidence hierarchy.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.83 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is an attitude statement, but prior V2/V3 calibration shows that for 'well insured' among limited budget segments, agreement is very low. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.16), which is also a low-importance attitude. This supports a low agreement estimate. V3 guidance for this specific concept is to use: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement), which matches the evidence and maintains the improved variance. No demographic uplift is warranted, as 'limited budgets' are not high-income or elderly. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment and direct V3 template match.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept ('It is important to be well insured for everything') is an attitude statement, but prior V2 and V3 calibration shows that for 'well insured for everything', agreement is much lower than for most attitudes, especially in budget-constrained segments. The most relevant quantitative anchor is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.16), which is also a low-agreement attitude about financial caution. This supports a low agreement estimate. V3 guidance is to use: SA 3%, A 12%, N 25%, D 32%, SD 28% (15% agreement), which matches the evidence and segment. No evidence suggests higher agreement, and the segment is 'limited budgets', so cost-averse and less likely to prioritize comprehensive insurance. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative anchor and direct V3 template match.

### Concept: Healthy Eating
Iterations: 2
Estimator average confidence: 0.85
Critic confidence: 0.98
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale correctly distinguishes between attitudes (the survey item) and behaviors (the quantitative toplines), noting that the latter are not direct proxies for the former. The V3 guidance is properly applied, with the +7pp correction for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes, and the critic feedback is respected by not letting behavior data unduly influence attitude estimates. There is no direct attitude evidence to warrant a downward adjustment, so the use of the V3 template is methodologically sound. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 20.00%
  Slightly agree: 40.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 20.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 8.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=20.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The V3 guidance specifies a +7pp correction for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes due to systematic under-prediction in V2. The available quantitative evidence (proportions of vegans, vegetarians, etc.) describes actual eating behaviors, not attitudes, and does not directly indicate that the 'limited budgets' segment holds weaker attitudes toward healthy eating. Without direct attitude data, the V3 template for 'Healthy Eating' (SA 20%, A 40%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%) should be used as the default. This approach is consistent with the critic feedback, which cautions against lowering agreement rates based solely on behavior data. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with V3 protocol and lack of contradictory evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=20.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The item is an attitude statement ('Healthy Eating') for the 'limited budgets' segment. V3 guidance specifies a +7pp correction for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes due to prior under-prediction, resulting in the template: SA 20%, A 40%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. The available quantitative evidence describes actual eating behaviors (vegan, vegetarian, etc.), which are not direct proxies for attitudes and should not be used to reduce agreement rates unless there is direct attitude data. There is no such direct evidence here, so the V3 template is applied as instructed. This approach is consistent with the critic feedback and V3 methodology.
Run 3: Strongly agree=20.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The target concept is 'Healthy Eating' (attitude), and the segment is 'limited budgets.' The only quantitative data provided relates to actual eating habits (vegan, vegetarian, etc.), which are not direct proxies for attitudes toward healthy eating. V3 guidance specifies that unless there is direct evidence of lower attitudes in this segment, the template for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes should be used: SA 20%, A 40%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%. There is no direct attitude evidence here, so no downward adjustment is justified. This estimate follows the V3 template and addresses the critic feedback by not letting behavior data unduly lower the attitude estimate.
Run 4: Strongly agree=20.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The item is an attitude statement ('Healthy Eating'), and the V3 guidance specifies a +7pp correction for this concept due to prior under-prediction. The quantitative evidence provided (proportions of vegans, vegetarians, etc.) reflects actual eating behaviors, not attitudes, and thus cannot be used to justify lowering agreement rates for attitudes. There is no direct evidence that the 'limited budgets' segment holds weaker attitudes toward healthy eating—only that their behaviors may not align due to constraints. Therefore, the V3 template for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes (SA 20%, A 40%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%) should be applied as the default. This approach is consistent with the critic feedback and the evidence hierarchy, which prioritizes direct attitude data over behavioral proxies.
Run 5: Strongly agree=20.00%, Slightly agree=40.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=8.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The V3 guidance for 'Healthy Eating' attitudes specifies a template of SA 20%, A 40%, N 20%, D 12%, SD 8%, with a +7pp correction due to prior under-prediction. The quantitative evidence provided (vegan, vegetarian, meat-eating rates) reflects actual eating behaviors, not attitudes, and does not directly justify lowering agreement rates. There is no direct attitude data indicating that the 'limited budgets' segment holds weaker attitudes toward healthy eating—only that their behaviors may not align due to constraints. Therefore, the V3 template should be applied as the default, as per the critic feedback and guidance. No downward adjustment is warranted without direct attitude evidence.

### Concept: Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for agreement with 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is sufficiently justified. The rationale correctly classifies the statement as an IDENTITY concept, applies the V3 template and concept-specific correction (+20pp), and appropriately considers the evidence hierarchy. The quantitative evidence (e.g., low intent to use other investments for retirement) is correctly interpreted as reflecting means rather than mindset, and related attitudes are used to support the plausibility of moderate-to-high self-reliance. The qualitative context is acknowledged, and the lack of need for demographic calibration is explained. The repeated application of the V3 template is justified by the lack of strong contradictory evidence. Overall, the justification is methodologically sound and confidence is high.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 28.00%
  Slightly agree: 35.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 18.00%
  Slightly disagree: 12.00%
  Strongly disagree: 7.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') is best classified as an IDENTITY statement, not just an attitude, per V3 guidance. This segment ('limited budgets') shows low intent to use other investments for retirement (9%), suggesting low proactive financial planning, but this does not directly contradict a belief in personal responsibility—it may reflect means, not mindset. The closest direct evidence is weak, so the V3 template for this concept is used: SA 28%, A 35%, N 18%, D 12%, SD 7% (63% agreement). No strong demographic calibration is needed, as the segment is not specifically high or low income, but the 'limited budgets' context may slightly reduce agreement, though not enough to override the concept-specific correction. Confidence is high due to strong V3 correction and clear concept classification.
Run 2: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is best classified as an IDENTITY item (self-reliance, self-concept), not just an attitude. V3 guidance specifies a higher agreement baseline for identity statements (SA 25%, A 37%, N 16%, D 13%, SD 9%). However, for this specific concept, V3 mandates a further +20pp correction due to V2's systematic under-prediction and strong evidence from national surveys showing high agreement with self-reliance in retirement. The provided segment is from a 'limited budgets' group, which may slightly reduce agreement, but the evidence hierarchy is dominated by the concept-specific correction. Quantitative evidence from the segment (e.g., only 9% plan to use other investments for retirement) suggests low proactive planning, but this does not directly contradict the belief in personal responsibility—it may reflect means, not attitudes. Therefore, the V3 template for this concept is applied: SA 28%, A 35%, N 18%, D 12%, SD 7%. Confidence is high due to strong concept-specific correction and alignment with national patterns.
Run 3: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The statement 'Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility' is best classified as an IDENTITY item (self-reliance, self-concept), not just an attitude. V3 guidance specifically calls for a +20pp correction over V2, using the IDENTITY template: SA 28%, A 35%, N 18%, D 12%, SD 7% (63% agreement). Quantitative evidence from this segment shows low intent to use other investments for retirement (9%), but this reflects behavior, not belief in responsibility. The segment's moderate agreement with other financial attitudes (e.g., saving for a purpose 38%, trust in comparison sites 52%, switching utilities 33%) supports a moderate-to-high self-reliance mindset. No evidence suggests a need to reduce the V3 template. Therefore, the V3 concept-specific correction is applied directly. Confidence is high due to direct template match and strong evidence hierarchy.
Run 4: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') is best classified as an IDENTITY statement, not just an attitude, per V3 guidance. This segment ('limited budgets') is likely to have slightly lower agreement than the general population, but the V3 template for this concept is: SA 28%, A 35%, N 18%, D 12%, SD 7% (63% agreement). Quantitative evidence is limited for this exact concept, but related attitudes (e.g., 'I only save for a specific purpose' at 38%, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 33%) suggest a pragmatic, self-reliant mindset, though with some constraints. No direct evidence contradicts the V3 template, so the base distribution is used. Confidence is high due to strong concept-specific correction and evidence hierarchy.
Run 5: Strongly agree=28.00%, Slightly agree=35.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=18.00%, Slightly disagree=12.00%, Strongly disagree=7.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The target concept ('Financial security after retirement is your own responsibility') is best classified as an IDENTITY statement, not just an attitude, per V3 guidance. This segment ('limited budgets') shows low intent to use other investments for retirement (9%), but this is a behavioral measure, not an attitude/identity. There is no direct quantitative evidence for the attitude, but related attitudes (e.g., 'I only save for a specific purpose' at 38%, 'Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort' at 33%) suggest a pragmatic, self-reliant mindset, albeit with limited means. V3 directs a +20pp correction for this specific concept due to V2 under-prediction, and the IDENTITY template baseline is 62% agreement. No demographic calibration is needed (limited budgets is not strictly low income, but is cost-constrained). Therefore, the recommended distribution is: Strongly agree 28%, Slightly agree 35%, Neither 18%, Slightly disagree 12%, Strongly disagree 7%. Confidence is high due to strong concept-specific correction and clear classification.

### Concept: Switching utilities suppliers is well worth the effort
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently applies the correct evidence hierarchy: quantitative data on high utility outgoings is used to establish salience, but not to overstate engagement with switching behaviors. The distinction between attitude and behavior templates is clearly made, and the final estimate (SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%) is well-aligned with both the V3 template and the segment's characteristics. The repeated runs show consistent reasoning, and the confidence level is appropriately high given the available evidence. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 8.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.00%
  Slightly disagree: 25.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement for the 'limited budgets' segment. Quantitative evidence shows high spending on utilities (council tax, utilities, water, etc.), which could increase the perceived value of switching, but actual switching rates among lower-income/limited budget groups are typically modest due to friction, inertia, and perceived hassle. The V3 template for 'Behavior (High Friction)' is SA 6%, A 20%, N 26%, D 26%, SD 22%. However, the concept here is 'well worth the effort' (attitude, not actual switching), so we use the 'attitude' template: SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. For this segment, we apply a slight upward calibration (+2pp to agreement) due to high utility costs, but not as much as for actual behavior. Final estimate: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative context and clear concept classification.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement about the perceived value of switching utilities suppliers. The segment is 'limited budgets', which typically increases cost-consciousness, but the quantitative evidence does not show high engagement with switching behaviors (no direct evidence of switching, and only moderate engagement with cost-saving activities). V3 baseline for 'Behavior (High Friction)' is SA 6%, A 20%, N 26%, D 26%, SD 22%. However, this is an attitude, not a behavior, so we use the attitude baseline (SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%) and then adjust downward for the high friction and low engagement context. The V3 template for this specific item is SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement), which matches the V3 guidance for this concept. Confidence is moderate-high due to alignment with both the V3 template and the segment's characteristics.
Run 3: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement for the 'limited budgets' segment. Quantitative evidence shows low engagement with sporting events and places of worship, suggesting limited discretionary spending and possibly lower engagement with non-essential activities. Outgoings are high for essentials (council tax, utilities, etc.), indicating that utilities are a significant part of their budget. However, the V3 template for 'Switching utilities worth effort' (attitude, high friction) is: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement). This matches the V3 baseline for this item, as there is no strong evidence that this group is more or less likely to agree than the general population. The evidence hierarchy is respected: quantitative data is relevant but not directly about switching behavior, so no upward or downward adjustment is warranted. Confidence is moderate-high due to the alignment of evidence and template.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement for the 'limited budgets' segment. The V3 baseline for 'behavior (high friction)' is SA 6%, A 20%, N 26%, D 26%, SD 22% (26% agreement), but this is an attitude about perceived worth, not actual switching behavior, so the 'attitude' template is more appropriate: SA 12%, A 30%, N 27%, D 18%, SD 13%. However, for this segment, the quantitative evidence shows high outgoings on utilities (suggesting salience), but the actual rate of sporting event attendance (0.16) and places of worship (0.08) suggest low engagement in optional activities, possibly due to time/effort constraints. V2 and V3 guidance for this item is to keep the V2 adjustment: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15% (30% agreement). This reflects that while the segment is cost-conscious, the perceived effort of switching is a barrier, and agreement is not high. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong alignment with both V3 and segment evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude item for the 'limited budgets' segment. The V3 baseline for 'behavior (high friction)' is SA 6%, A 20%, N 26%, D 26%, SD 22%. However, the concept-specific correction for 'Switching utilities worth effort' is to keep the V2 adjustment: SA 8%, A 22%, N 30%, D 25%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows this segment is cost-conscious (high outgoings on utilities), but actual switching behavior is typically low due to friction and hassle, which aligns with the V2/V3 template. No evidence suggests a higher or lower agreement than the V3 default for this item. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment characteristics and the concept-specific template.

### Concept: I like to use cash when making purchases
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I like to use cash when making purchases' for the 'limited budgets' segment is well justified. The topline quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 18%, pet care 23%), which is a strong behavioral proxy for cash preference. The higher online rates for big-ticket items (home appliances, holidays) are consistent with occasional exceptions rather than routine behavior. The rationale in each run clearly links the evidence to the attitude estimate, and the use of the V3 template (with a slight upward calibration for this segment) is methodologically sound. The confidence is high due to the direct behavioral evidence and the segment's known characteristics. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 15.00%
  Slightly agree: 25.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 12.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: This is an attitude statement for the 'limited budgets' segment. Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday items (alcoholic drinks 18%, pet care 23%), with higher rates for big-ticket items (home appliances 52%, holidays 51%). This suggests a preference for in-person/cash transactions for routine purchases, but willingness to use online (and thus less cash) for larger purchases. V3 guidance for 'like to use cash' is to use the attitude template, but with a slight increase (+5pp) due to the segment's likely cash orientation and low digital engagement. The resulting estimate is: SA 15%, A 25%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 12%. This reflects a moderate but not overwhelming preference for cash, with a substantial neutral/mixed group. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative alignment.

Run 4: Strongly agree=15.00%, Slightly agree=25.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The segment is 'ACORN Limited Budgets', which typically skews toward older, lower-income, and more cash-reliant consumers. The item is an attitude statement ('I like to use cash when making purchases'). Quantitative evidence shows low online purchase rates for everyday categories (alcoholic drinks 18%, pet care 23%), with only higher-ticket items (home appliances, holidays) reaching ~51%. This suggests a strong preference for in-person, likely cash-based transactions for routine purchases. V3 guidance for 'like to use cash' is to use: SA 15%, A 25%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 12% (40% agreement), which fits both the segment and the evidence. No direct quantitative data on cash preference, but the low online purchase rates for daily goods strongly imply above-average cash use. Confidence is high due to strong alignment between segment profile and observed behavior.
