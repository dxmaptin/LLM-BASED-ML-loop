### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.70
Critic confidence: 0.80
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale for maintaining the baseline attitude distribution is sound: the quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related to behaviors rather than direct attitudes, and the values are low, indicating limited behavioral endorsement. The demographic data (country of birth) is not directly relevant to the attitude concept. The qualitative notes do not provide strong directional evidence. Therefore, the decision to retain the baseline distribution for attitudes is appropriate, and the confidence level is correctly described as moderate due to the lack of direct, highly relevant evidence. No corrective action is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.70 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution for attitudes is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly measure agreement with an attitude statement, and the values are low, suggesting limited behavioral endorsement. The qualitative notes do not provide strong directional evidence. Therefore, the baseline is maintained with no significant demographic or evidence-based adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct, high-relevance quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but relates to behaviors rather than direct attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited agreement with the specific behaviors referenced. The country of birth data (Rest of Europe 1.6%, Other 4.2%) is not directly relevant to the attitude concept. No strong evidence overrides the baseline, so the default attitude distribution is maintained. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of highly relevant direct evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution for attitudes is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly measuring agreement with an attitude statement, and its relevance is just below the threshold for strong override (relevance values 0.76-0.80). The qualitative note is generic and does not provide additional directional evidence. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related to behaviors and does not directly reflect attitudes toward the target concept. The country of birth data (Rest of Europe 1.6%, Other 4.2%) is demographic and not directly relevant to the attitude in question. No strong evidence is present to override the baseline. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained, with moderate confidence due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.70 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline attitude distribution is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but pertains to specific behaviors rather than general attitudes, and their values are low, suggesting limited agreement with the specific behaviors. The demographic evidence (country of birth) also shows low values. No strong evidence is present to override the baseline, so the default attitude distribution is maintained. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of highly relevant or strong evidence.

### Concept: I always make an effort to recycle
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.82
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references highly relevant quantitative evidence for similar pro-social and pro-environmental attitudes (supporting local/British businesses, reducing meat consumption), all of which show low agreement (11-16%). This evidence is directly analogous to the recycling attitude in question, and the repeated downward adjustment from the attitude baseline is methodologically sound. The qualitative note on internet usage is not directly relevant to recycling attitudes, and its omission from the weighting is appropriate. The confidence in the estimate is well-supported by the strength and relevance of the quantitative evidence. No major gaps or unjustified leaps are present in the reasoning.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 7.20%
  Slightly agree: 18.60%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 30.80%
  Slightly disagree: 23.80%
  Strongly disagree: 19.60%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, direct quantitative evidence for similar pro-social/eco-friendly attitudes (supporting local/British businesses, reducing meat consumption) is quite low (11-16% agreement), with high relevance (0.94-0.98). This suggests agreement for 'I always make an effort to recycle' is likely well below baseline. Weighted heavily toward neutral/disagree, with agreement (SA+A) set at 25% to reflect the low observed values. No strong demographic calibration indicated. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=21.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I always make an effort to recycle'). The closest quantitative evidence shows low agreement for similar pro-social and pro-environmental attitudes in this segment (e.g., 14% for supporting local businesses, 16% for supporting British businesses, 11% for reducing meat consumption). These values are well below the attitude baseline (37% agreement). Recycling is a common pro-environmental behavior, but the segment's low agreement with similar statements suggests agreement will also be low here. Therefore, the distribution is shifted downward from the baseline, with more respondents in neutral or disagreement categories. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence suggests a higher or lower value. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong relevance of the quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, direct quantitative evidence for similar pro-social/eco-friendly attitudes (supporting local/British businesses, reducing meat consumption) is low (11-16% agreement), with high relevance (0.94-0.98). This suggests agreement for 'I always make an effort to recycle' will also be low in this segment. Adjusted distribution downward for agreement, increasing disagreement and keeping neutral high. No strong demographic calibration indicated. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=24.00%, Strongly disagree=19.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, direct quantitative evidence for similar pro-social/eco-friendly attitudes (supporting local/British businesses, reducing meat consumption) is low (values 0.11–0.16), indicating lower agreement than baseline. These are highly relevant (relevance >0.9), so they override the baseline. Distribution is shifted downward: agreement (SA+A) is reduced, neutral and disagreement increased. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Confidence is high due to strong direct evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=24.00%, Strongly disagree=19.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I always make an effort to recycle'). The closest quantitative evidence shows low agreement for similar pro-social or pro-environmental attitudes in this segment (e.g., 14% for supporting local businesses, 16% for supporting British businesses, 11% for reducing meat consumption). These are all below the attitude baseline (37% agreement), indicating this segment is less likely than average to strongly agree with pro-environmental or community-supporting statements. Therefore, the distribution is shifted downward from the baseline, with a higher proportion in neutral and disagreement categories. No strong demographic calibration is warranted based on the provided context. Confidence is high due to the high relevance and consistency of the quantitative evidence.
