### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.71
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The topline quantitative data relates to behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging accounts by phone) with moderate relevance scores (0.76-0.80), but these are not direct measures of the target attitude concept. The qualitative notes are minimal and do not provide additional direction. The rationale for maintaining the baseline attitude distribution is sound: the evidence is related but not directly indicative of the attitude in question, and the relevance scores do not meet the threshold for overriding the baseline. The repeated application of the baseline across runs, with moderate confidence, is appropriate given the lack of direct, high-relevance evidence. No major demographic or qualitative adjustments are warranted. Therefore, the estimate is methodologically justified and does not require revision.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly about the target attitude concept, and the relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative notes are minimal and do not provide additional directional evidence. No significant demographic calibration is indicated. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline attitude distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly about the target attitude concept, and its relevance is just below the threshold for strong override (relevance 0.77-0.80). The evidence suggests low engagement in the referenced behaviors, but since the concept is attitudinal and the evidence is only moderately relevant, the baseline is maintained with no major adjustments. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence is present to warrant further calibration.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but pertains to behaviors rather than direct attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited engagement or agreement with the specific behaviors. No strong evidence is present to override the baseline. Demographic calibrations are not indicated as necessary based on the evidence. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct, high-relevance quantitative attitude data.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution for attitudes is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly indicate strong agreement or disagreement with a general attitude concept, and the values are low. The qualitative notes are not informative for shifting the baseline. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained, with moderate confidence due to the lack of direct, high-relevance evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly about the target attitude concept, and its relevance is just below the threshold for strong override (relevance values 0.76-0.80). The qualitative notes are minimal and do not provide strong directional evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained with no significant demographic or evidence-based adjustments. Confidence is moderate due to the presence of some related quantitative data, but none is directly decisive.

### Concept: I do not mind paying more for organic food
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.87
Critic confidence: 0.98
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The topline quantitative evidence for 'Interests & Hobbies | Organic Foods' is extremely low (0.0464) and highly relevant (0.98), directly supporting the prediction of strong disagreement with paying more for organic food. The supporting evidence for premium ranges and risk-taking is also low, reinforcing the conclusion. The qualitative note about planning and weekly shopping does not contradict or undermine the quantitative evidence. The rationale for each run consistently prioritizes the most relevant evidence and appropriately shifts the attitude distribution toward disagreement. The confidence in the estimate is high due to the directness and strength of the evidence used. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 3.60%
  Slightly agree: 9.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 26.20%
  Slightly disagree: 31.60%
  Strongly disagree: 28.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=11.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I do not mind paying more for organic food'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the very low interest in organic foods (value=0.0464, relevance=0.98), which is far below the attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). This suggests strong disagreement with paying more for organic food. Other evidence (premium ranges 0.17, board games/cards 0.24, risk-taking 0.20) is less relevant but also low, supporting a generally low willingness to pay extra or take risks. The qualitative note about planning and weekly shopping does not indicate a preference for organic or premium. Therefore, the baseline is shifted strongly toward disagreement, with a majority in 'slightly disagree' and 'strongly disagree', and very low agreement. Confidence is high due to the direct, highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=26.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=28.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I do not mind paying more for organic food'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the very low interest in organic foods (value=0.0464, relevance=0.98), which is far below the baseline for agreement. This suggests strong disagreement with the statement. Other related evidence (e.g., premium ranges at 0.1654) is also low, reinforcing a tendency to disagree. Qualitative notes about planning and weekly shopping do not indicate a preference for organic or premium products. Therefore, the distribution is shifted heavily toward disagreement, with only a small proportion agreeing. Confidence is high due to the direct, highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=10.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=26.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I do not mind paying more for organic food'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the very low value for 'Interests & Hobbies | Organic Foods' (0.05), which is highly relevant (0.98) and indicates extremely low interest in organic foods in this segment. This strongly suggests low agreement with paying more for organic food. Other evidence (e.g., premium ranges at 0.17, risk-taking at 0.20) is less directly relevant but also suggests a low tendency toward premium or organic purchases. The qualitative note about planning and weekly shopping does not indicate a preference for organic or premium. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is shifted strongly toward disagreement, with a large increase in 'slightly disagree' and 'strongly disagree', and a reduction in agreement. Confidence is high due to the direct, highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=8.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=24.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=33.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I do not mind paying more for organic food'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the very low value for 'Interests & Hobbies | Organic Foods' (0.0464, or ~5%), with high relevance (0.98), indicating extremely low interest in organic foods in this segment. This is strong direct evidence and should heavily override the attitude baseline (which would be 10/27/28/20/15). Other evidence (e.g., premium ranges at 0.17, risk-taking at 0.20) is less directly relevant but also suggests low willingness to pay extra. The qualitative note about planning and weekly shopping does not indicate a preference for premium or organic. Therefore, the distribution is shifted strongly toward disagreement, with very low agreement. Confidence is high due to the direct, highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=8.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=25.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=32.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I do not mind paying more for organic food'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the very low value for 'Interests & Hobbies | Organic Foods' (0.0464, relevance=0.98), indicating extremely low interest in organic foods in this segment. This is strong direct evidence and should heavily override the baseline. Other related evidence (e.g., low engagement with premium ranges and risk-taking) also suggests low willingness to pay extra for organic or premium products. The qualitative note about planning and weekly shopping does not indicate a preference for organic or premium. Therefore, the distribution is heavily weighted toward disagreement, with a small minority agreeing, and a moderate neutral group. Confidence is high due to the strength and relevance of the quantitative evidence.
