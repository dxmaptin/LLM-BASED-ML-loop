### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.72
Critic confidence: 0.80
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale correctly identifies that the quantitative evidence provided is behavioral and not directly attitudinal, with relatively low values that do not warrant overriding the baseline attitude distribution. The lack of strong demographic or qualitative evidence is also appropriately noted. The repeated application of the baseline attitude distribution is reasonable in this context, and the confidence level is appropriately described as moderate due to the indirectness of the evidence. No corrective action is needed unless more direct attitudinal or demographic evidence becomes available.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution for attitudes is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly indicate strong agreement or disagreement with a general attitude statement. The evidence is more behavioral and specific, with moderate relevance (0.76-0.80), but does not warrant overriding the attitude baseline. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence is present to justify further adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct attitude evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.70 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution for attitudes is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly indicate strong agreement or disagreement with a general attitude statement, and the values are low, suggesting limited behavioral endorsement. The qualitative evidence is minimal and not directly informative. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but pertains to behaviors rather than direct attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited agreement with related behaviors. No strong direct attitude evidence is present, so the baseline is only slightly informed by the low behavioral uptake, but not enough to shift the distribution. Demographic calibrations are not indicated by the evidence. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct attitude data.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly measure agreement with an attitude statement, and the values are low, suggesting little behavioral engagement but not necessarily strong attitudes. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence is present to warrant deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is used, with moderate confidence due to the lack of direct attitudinal evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the attitude baseline is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but not directly about attitudes, and the highest value is still low, suggesting little deviation from baseline. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated by the evidence. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is used with moderate confidence.

### Concept: I am actively trying to reduce my meat consumption
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.79
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The main quantitative indicator ('fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', value=0.13, relevance=0.98) is highly relevant as a proxy for pro-environmental attitudes, and it is reasonable to infer that low prioritization of fuel consumption would correlate with low prioritization of other environmentally motivated behaviors, such as reducing meat consumption. The rationale for adjusting the baseline downward for agreement and upward for disagreement is clearly articulated and consistently applied across runs. Demographic notes are appropriately considered as a minor moderating factor. The confidence level is appropriately set to moderate-high, reflecting the strength of the main evidence and the lack of direct evidence on meat reduction. No major methodological flaws are apparent, and the evidence selection is balanced and transparent.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 6.60%
  Slightly agree: 17.40%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 29.60%
  Slightly disagree: 26.20%
  Strongly disagree: 20.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=26.00%, Strongly disagree=21.00%
  Conf=0.77 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The most relevant quantitative evidence is for a different but related attitude ('fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car', value=0.13, relevance=0.98), indicating low prioritization of environmentally-motivated choices in this segment. No direct evidence about meat consumption, but the low value for fuel consumption as a priority suggests a lower-than-baseline agreement for active meat reduction. Demographic notes (couples, young families, degree) might slightly increase agreement, but not enough to offset the low environmental concern signal. Adjusted downward from baseline for agreement, upward for disagreement. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong relevance of the main evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.13, relevance=0.98), which suggests low prioritization of environmentally motivated behaviors in this segment. No direct evidence about meat reduction, but the low value for fuel consumption as a priority implies a lower-than-baseline agreement for similar pro-environmental attitudes. Demographic notes (couples, young families, degree) do not strongly shift the baseline. Therefore, agreement is adjusted downward, with more respondents likely to disagree or remain neutral. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong relevance of the fuel consumption item.
Run 3: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=24.00%, Strongly disagree=19.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude ("I am actively trying to reduce my meat consumption"). Baseline for attitudes is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.13, relevance=0.98), which suggests low prioritization of environmentally-motivated behaviors in this segment. No direct evidence about meat reduction, but the low value for a similar pro-environmental attitude justifies shifting the distribution toward disagreement and neutrality. Demographic notes (young families, degree) might slightly increase agreement, but not enough to override the strong quantitative signal. Confidence is moderate-high due to high relevance of the main evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=26.00%, Strongly disagree=20.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I am actively trying to reduce my meat consumption'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the low agreement (0.13) for 'fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car,' indicating limited prioritization of environmentally-motivated attitudes in this segment. Other evidence (e.g., financial product consideration, trust in price comparison sites) is less directly relevant. The qualitative profile (couples, young families, degree holders) suggests a moderately progressive demographic, but not strongly so. Therefore, I weighted the baseline attitude distribution downward for agreement, resulting in a lower proportion agreeing and a higher proportion disagreeing or neutral. Confidence is moderate-high due to the high relevance of the main quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=21.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'Fuel consumption is the most important feature when buying a new car' (value=0.13, relevance=0.98), which is a strong indicator of low prioritization of environmentally motivated behaviors in this segment. This suggests that active attempts to reduce meat consumption (another pro-environmental behavior) are likely to be even less common. Other evidence (financial product consideration, online account management, trust in price comparison sites) is less relevant to the target concept. Demographic notes (couples, young families, degree) might slightly increase openness to change, but the strong negative evidence dominates. Therefore, the distribution is shifted toward disagreement and neutrality, with agreement much lower than baseline. Confidence is high due to the direct, highly relevant quantitative evidence.
