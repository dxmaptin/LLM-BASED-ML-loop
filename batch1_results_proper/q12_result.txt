### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.72
Critic confidence: 0.80
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale correctly identifies that the quantitative evidence provided pertains to specific behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging accounts by phone) rather than direct attitudes, and the values are low, indicating limited engagement with those behaviors. The qualitative notes do not provide additional directional information. As such, maintaining the baseline attitude distribution is appropriate, and the confidence level is moderate due to the lack of direct, high-relevance attitude evidence. No corrective action is needed unless more direct attitudinal data becomes available.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution for attitudes is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but pertains to specific behaviors rather than general attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited agreement with those specific behaviors. There is no strong direct evidence to override the baseline, and the qualitative notes do not provide additional directional information. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline attitude distribution is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but relates to behaviors rather than direct attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited agreement with the specific behaviors referenced. No strong direct attitude evidence is present, so the baseline is only minimally adjusted. Demographic calibrations are not applicable due to lack of specific demographic context. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct, high-relevance attitude evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution for attitudes is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly measure agreement with an attitude statement, and the highest relevance is 0.80, just at the threshold for strong evidence. However, the values are low and pertain to behaviors rather than attitudes, so they do not warrant overriding the baseline. Demographic calibrations are not indicated by the evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained, with moderate confidence due to the lack of direct attitudinal evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., low values for 'Manage current account by phone' and 'Arrange current account by phone') is relevant but does not directly indicate strong attitudes for or against the concept, and the relevance scores are just at or below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative note is not informative. No demographic calibration is warranted. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of strong, directly relevant evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the attitude baseline is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but relates to behaviors rather than direct attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited agreement with related behaviors. No strong evidence directly about attitudes is present, so the baseline is only minimally adjusted. Demographic calibrations are not indicated by the evidence. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct, high-relevance attitude data.

### Concept: I make an effort to support British businesses
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.84
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The simulated survey predictions for 'I make an effort to support British businesses' are consistently grounded in the most relevant quantitative evidence: 'I make an effort to support local businesses' (value=0.1383, relevance=0.98). This is a highly relevant and low value, indicating low agreement in this segment, and the distributions reflect this by showing low agreement and higher neutrality/disagreement. Other available evidence (recycling, willingness to pay more) is less relevant and appropriately given less weight. The demographic notes do not provide strong reason to deviate from the quantitative topline. The rationales are consistent and transparent, and the confidence is appropriately high given the strength and relevance of the evidence. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 5.20%
  Slightly agree: 14.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 31.20%
  Slightly disagree: 27.60%
  Strongly disagree: 21.20%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=19.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I make an effort to support British businesses'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'I make an effort to support local businesses' (value=0.14, relevance=0.98), which is very low and highly relevant, indicating low agreement in this segment. The recycling and 'prepared to pay more' items are less directly related and show higher agreement, but their relevance is lower. Demographically, the segment skews toward couples and young families with degrees, but there is no strong evidence this would substantially increase support for British businesses. Therefore, the distribution is shifted toward disagreement and neutrality, with only a small proportion agreeing, reflecting the low direct evidence. Confidence is high due to the strong, relevant quantitative topline.
Run 2: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=10.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=26.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I make an effort to support British businesses'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'I make an effort to support local businesses' (value=0.14, relevance=0.98), which is very low and highly relevant, indicating only 14% agreement. This is much lower than the attitude baseline (37% agreement). Other evidence (e.g., recycling, willingness to pay more) is less relevant and higher, but does not directly pertain to supporting British/local businesses. Demographic notes (couples, young families, degree) do not suggest a strong deviation from the evidence. Therefore, the distribution is shifted strongly toward disagreement, with a small minority agreeing, and the majority disagreeing or neutral. Confidence is high due to the direct, highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=6.00%, Slightly agree=18.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=25.00%, Strongly disagree=19.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I make an effort to support British businesses'). The most directly relevant quantitative evidence is 'I make an effort to support local businesses' (value=0.14, relevance=0.98), which is much lower than the attitude baseline (37% agreement). Other related attitudes (e.g., recycling at 0.44, willingness to pay more at 0.52) are higher, but less directly relevant. The qualitative profile (couples, young families, degree) does not suggest a strong deviation from baseline. Given the very low direct agreement (14%), the distribution is shifted toward disagreement and neutrality, with agreement much lower than baseline. Confidence is high due to the strong, highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=14.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=21.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I make an effort to support British businesses'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'I make an effort to support local businesses' (value=0.14, relevance=0.98), which is very low and highly relevant, indicating low agreement. The recycling and 'pay more for convenience' items are less relevant and show higher agreement, but the local business support item should dominate. Demographic notes (couples, young families, degree) do not suggest a strong deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the distribution is shifted toward disagreement and neutrality, with agreement much lower than the attitude baseline. Confidence is high due to the direct, highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=14.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=21.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I make an effort to support British businesses'). The most directly relevant quantitative evidence is 'I make an effort to support local businesses' (value=0.14, relevance=0.98), which is very low and highly relevant, so it strongly overrides the baseline (attitude baseline: 10/27/28/20/15). Other attitude items (e.g., recycling, paying more for convenience) are higher but less relevant. Demographic notes (young families, degree) do not suggest a strong deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the distribution is shifted toward disagreement and neutrality, with agreement much lower than baseline, reflecting the very low direct agreement rate in the evidence. Confidence is high due to the high relevance and clarity of the quantitative evidence.
