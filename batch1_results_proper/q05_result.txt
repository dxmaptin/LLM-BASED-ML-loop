### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.71
Critic confidence: 0.80
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale correctly identifies that the available quantitative evidence (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related to behaviors rather than direct attitudes, and the relevance scores are below the threshold for overriding the baseline. The qualitative notes are generic and do not provide additional direction. The decision to maintain the baseline attitude distribution is appropriate, and the confidence level is correctly described as moderate due to the lack of strong, directly relevant evidence. No revision is necessary.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The concept type is 'attitude', so the baseline distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly about the target attitude concept, and the relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative note is generic and does not provide additional directional evidence. No demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is used (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account by phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account by phone' at 2.6%) is related to behaviors rather than direct attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited engagement or agreement with the related behaviors. However, since these are not direct attitude measures and their relevance is just below the strong threshold (0.79, 0.77), they do not override the baseline. Demographic calibrations are not indicated as necessary from the evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained, with moderate confidence due to lack of direct attitude evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution for attitudes is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly indicate strong agreement or disagreement with a general attitude statement, and the values are low. The qualitative notes do not provide strong directional evidence. Therefore, the baseline is maintained with no significant demographic or evidence-driven adjustments. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of strong, directly relevant evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the attitude baseline is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but pertains to specific behaviors rather than general attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited agreement with those specific actions. The country of birth breakdowns are also low in value and do not directly inform the attitude concept. No strong evidence overrides the baseline, so the default attitude distribution is maintained. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of highly relevant, strong evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution for attitudes is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly indicate strong agreement or disagreement with a general attitude statement. The values are low and pertain to specific behaviors, not broad attitudes, so they do not warrant overriding the baseline. Demographic calibrations are not applicable due to lack of specific demographic focus. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of strong, directly relevant evidence.

### Concept: I consider myself an environmentalist
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.76
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I consider myself an environmentalist' is well justified based on the provided evidence. The rationale consistently applies the identity baseline and then adjusts downward in light of the quantitative data (low agreement with related attitudes, very low environmental charity giving) and qualitative notes (environmental concern without willingness to pay extra). The repeated reference to the baseline and the systematic downward adjustment are methodologically sound. The evidence selection is appropriate and relevant, and the confidence level is correctly described as moderate to moderate-high. No major gaps or misinterpretations are evident. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 22.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 29.60%
  Slightly disagree: 22.60%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: Concept type is identity ("I consider myself an environmentalist"), so baseline is SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, the quantitative evidence shows low agreement with related environmental attitudes: only 26% agree brands should consider sustainability at events, and only 7% give to environmental/wildlife charities. Qualitative notes indicate some care about the environment but are unwilling to pay extra for eco-friendly products, suggesting weak identification with environmentalism. Therefore, agreement is adjusted downward from baseline, with more respondents likely to be neutral or slightly disagree. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated. Confidence is moderate due to strong relevance of quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=24.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is an identity statement ('I consider myself an environmentalist'), so the identity baseline applies (SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%). However, the quantitative evidence shows only 7% donate to environmental/wildlife charities and only about 26% agree with pro-environmental attitudes. Qualitative notes indicate they care about the environment but are not willing to pay extra for environmentally friendly products, suggesting a gap between concern and strong self-identification. Therefore, agreement is adjusted downward from the identity baseline, with more respondents likely to be neutral or slightly disagree. The distribution reflects a lower-than-baseline agreement, with a higher neutral and disagreement share. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The target concept is an identity statement ('I consider myself an environmentalist'), so the identity baseline applies (SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%). However, the quantitative evidence shows only 7% give to environmental/wildlife charities and only about 26% agree with pro-environmental attitudes, both much lower than the baseline. Qualitative notes indicate some care about the environment but are not willing to pay extra, suggesting weak identification. Therefore, agreement rates are adjusted downward, with more respondents likely to be neutral or slightly disagree. The distribution is shifted toward neutrality and slight disagreement, with lower agreement than the identity baseline. Confidence is moderate due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is an identity statement ('I consider myself an environmentalist'), so the identity baseline applies (SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%). However, the quantitative evidence shows only moderate agreement with related environmental attitudes (around 26% agreement on brands and energy companies), and very low engagement with environmental/wildlife charities (7%). Qualitative notes indicate some care for the environment but a reluctance to pay extra for environmentally friendly products, suggesting weak identification. Therefore, agreement rates are adjusted downward from the identity baseline, with more respondents likely to be neutral or slightly disagree. The final distribution reflects lower agreement and higher neutrality/disagreement than the baseline. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong relevance of the evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is an identity statement ('I consider myself an environmentalist'), so the identity baseline applies (SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%). However, the quantitative evidence shows low agreement with related environmental attitudes (around 26% agree that brands should consider sustainability, and 27% agree that energy companies do not care about the environment). Charitable giving to environmental causes is very low (7%), and qualitative notes indicate people care about the environment but are not willing to pay extra for environmentally friendly products. This suggests weaker identification with the 'environmentalist' label than the baseline. Therefore, agreement is reduced and disagreement increased relative to the identity baseline. The distribution is shifted toward neutrality and slight disagreement, with only a minority agreeing. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence.
