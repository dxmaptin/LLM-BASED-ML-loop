### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.71
Critic confidence: 0.80
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale correctly identifies that the quantitative evidence provided is related to behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging accounts by phone) rather than directly measuring attitudes, and the relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative notes are minimal and do not provide direct attitudinal evidence. Therefore, maintaining the baseline attitude distribution is appropriate, and the confidence level is reasonably set as moderate. No corrective action is needed unless more directly relevant attitudinal evidence becomes available.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related to behaviors rather than attitudes, and their relevance is just below the threshold for strong override (all <0.8 except one at 0.80). The qualitative note is generic and does not provide direct attitudinal evidence. Therefore, the baseline for attitudes is maintained with no significant demographic or evidence-based adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct attitudinal evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.70 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly about agreement with an attitude statement, and its relevance is just below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative notes are minimal and do not provide additional directional evidence. Therefore, the baseline for attitudes is maintained, with no significant demographic or evidence-based adjustments. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of directly relevant, high-relevance quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution for attitudes is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but pertains to specific behaviors rather than general attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited agreement with the specific behaviors. The country of birth data (values 0.02 and 0.04) are also low and not directly related to the attitude concept. No strong evidence justifies deviating from the attitude baseline. Therefore, the baseline is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly measuring agreement with an attitude statement, and its relevance is just below the strong threshold (0.79, 0.77). Therefore, the baseline is maintained with no significant adjustment. Qualitative evidence is minimal and does not warrant a shift. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct, highly relevant evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept type is attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly about the target attitude concept, and the relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative note is not informative. Therefore, the baseline is maintained with no significant demographic or evidence-based adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.

### Concept: I think energy companies do not care about the environment
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.68
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The runs consistently reference both quantitative and qualitative data: low self-identification as environmentalists (8%), moderate importance placed on environmental features when buying a car (13-39%), and qualitative notes indicating environmental concern but reluctance to pay extra. The rationale for modestly increasing agreement (SA/A) over the baseline is sound, reflecting plausible skepticism toward energy companies without overstating cynicism. The lack of direct evidence about energy companies is acknowledged, and confidence is appropriately rated as moderate. No major methodological flaws are present, and the evidence selection is balanced. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 14.20%
  Slightly agree: 29.40%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 29.20%
  Slightly disagree: 16.40%
  Strongly disagree: 10.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=14.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=29.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude (opinion about energy companies' environmental concern). Baseline for attitudes is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows low self-identification as environmentalist (8%) and moderate importance placed on environmental features when buying a car (39%), suggesting some environmental concern but not strongly held. Qualitative evidence indicates people care about the environment but are not willing to pay extra, implying skepticism toward companies' motives is plausible but not extreme. No direct evidence about energy companies, so baseline is only slightly adjusted: slightly higher agreement (SA/A) due to general skepticism, but high neutrality and moderate disagreement remain. Confidence is moderate due to indirect evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=29.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=16.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I think...'), so the attitude baseline applies. Quantitative evidence shows low self-identification as environmentalists (8%) and moderate importance placed on environmental features when buying a car (39%), suggesting some environmental concern but not strong. Qualitative evidence indicates that while the segment cares about the environment, they are not willing to pay extra for environmentally friendly products, implying skepticism about companies' environmental motives. This supports a moderate agreement with the statement, but the high neutral and slight disagreement rates reflect ambivalence and lack of strong environmental identity. No major demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is moderate due to indirect evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=29.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=11.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude (opinion about energy companies' environmental concern). Baseline for attitudes is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows low self-identification as environmentalist (8%) and low prioritization of environmental features when buying a car (13-39%), suggesting moderate skepticism but not strong environmental engagement. Qualitative evidence indicates care for the environment but reluctance to pay extra, implying some distrust of companies' motives but not extreme cynicism. Adjusted baseline slightly toward agreement and neutral, with a small reduction in strong disagreement. No major demographic calibration applied. Confidence is moderate due to indirect evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=32.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=14.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude (opinion about energy companies' environmental concern). Baseline for attitudes is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows low self-identification as environmentalist (8%) and moderate importance for environmental features when buying a car (39%), suggesting some environmental concern but not strong activism. Qualitative evidence indicates people care about the environment but are not willing to pay extra for it, implying skepticism toward companies' motives. This supports a slight upward adjustment in agreement (SA/A) that energy companies do not care about the environment, as people may project their own skepticism onto companies. Final distribution is modestly shifted toward agreement, with confidence moderate due to indirect evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=29.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows low self-identification as environmentalists (8%) and moderate importance placed on environmental features when buying a car (39%), suggesting some concern but not strong. Qualitative evidence indicates the segment cares about the environment but is not willing to pay extra, implying skepticism toward companies' environmental claims. No direct evidence about attitudes toward energy companies, but the general skepticism and low environmentalist identity suggest slightly higher agreement than baseline. Adjusted agreement up by 2pp, with a small reduction in strong disagreement. Confidence is moderate due to indirect evidence.
