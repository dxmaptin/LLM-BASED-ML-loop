### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.71
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale for maintaining the baseline attitude distribution is sound: the quantitative evidence (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but pertains to specific behaviors rather than the general attitude concept being measured. The relevance scores for these behavioral items are below the threshold for overriding the baseline, and the qualitative notes do not provide additional directional evidence. No demographic calibration is indicated by the evidence. The repeated application of the baseline with moderate confidence is appropriate in the absence of strong, directly relevant attitudinal data. No corrective action is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution for attitudes is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but pertains to specific behaviors rather than general attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited agreement with those specific behaviors. No strong evidence directly overrides the attitude baseline. Demographic calibrations are not indicated as necessary based on the evidence. Therefore, the baseline is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is used (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly about the target attitude concept, and the relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative notes are minimal and do not provide additional directional evidence. No demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained, with moderate confidence due to the lack of strong direct evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly measure agreement with an attitude statement, and the highest value is only 11%. These values suggest low engagement with the specific behaviors referenced, but since the concept is attitudinal and not behavioral, the evidence does not strongly override the baseline. Demographic calibrations are not indicated by the evidence. Therefore, the baseline is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline attitude distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly relevant to the core attitude concept, and the relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative notes are minimal and do not shift the baseline. No significant demographic calibration is indicated. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the attitude baseline is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly measure agreement with an attitude statement, and the values are low, suggesting limited behavioral endorsement. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence is present to justify deviation from the baseline. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained, with moderate confidence due to the lack of direct attitudinal evidence.

### Concept: I make an effort to support local businesses
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.87
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The direct quantitative evidence for 'I make an effort to support British businesses' (value=0.16, relevance=0.98) is highly relevant and clearly supports a much lower agreement rate than the baseline for attitudes. The rationale consistently explains the strong weighting of this evidence, and the distribution of responses (with only 16% agreeing and the majority neutral or disagreeing) is methodologically sound. The use of less relevant evidence (recycling, demographics) is appropriately limited, and the confidence in the estimate is warranted given the strength and relevance of the primary evidence. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 4.00%
  Slightly agree: 12.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 32.00%
  Strongly disagree: 24.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=24.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, direct quantitative evidence for 'I make an effort to support British businesses' in this segment is 0.16 (16%), which is much lower than the baseline agreement (37%). This is highly relevant (relevance=0.98), so it receives strong weighting. The recycling attitude (0.44) is higher, but less directly relevant. Demographic notes (couples, young families, degree) do not suggest a major deviation from the segment's low agreement. Therefore, the distribution is shifted heavily toward disagreement, matching the low topline value and maintaining variance. Confidence is high due to strong direct quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=24.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I make an effort to support local businesses'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'I make an effort to support British businesses' (value=0.16, relevance=0.98), which is very closely related and indicates only 16% agreement. This is much lower than the attitude baseline (37% agreement), so the distribution is shifted strongly toward disagreement. The recycling item (value=0.44) is less relevant but shows higher agreement, suggesting that this segment is more pro-environment than pro-local-business. Demographic notes (couples, young families, degree) do not suggest a strong deviation from the evidence. Therefore, the distribution is weighted heavily toward disagreement, with a small minority agreeing, and a large neutral/disagreeing group. Confidence is high due to the direct, highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=24.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, direct quantitative evidence for 'I make an effort to support British businesses' in this segment is 0.16 (16%), which is much lower than the baseline agreement (37%). This is highly relevant (relevance=0.98), so it receives 80% weight and pulls agreement down sharply. Related attitude on recycling is higher (0.44), but less relevant. Demographic notes (young families, degree) do not suggest a strong deviation. Therefore, the distribution is shifted toward disagreement, with agreement (SA+A) matching the 16% topline, and disagreement increased accordingly. Confidence is high due to strong direct evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=24.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, direct quantitative evidence for 'I make an effort to support British businesses' in this segment is 0.16 (16%), which is much lower than the baseline agreement (37%). This is highly relevant (relevance=0.98), so it should strongly override the baseline. The recycling attitude (0.44) is higher but less relevant (0.80), and the other behaviors are not directly relevant. Demographic notes (couples, young families, degree) do not suggest a strong deviation from the segment's observed low agreement. Therefore, the distribution is shifted heavily toward disagreement and neutrality, with only a small proportion agreeing. Confidence is high due to strong, highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=12.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=24.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, direct quantitative evidence for 'I make an effort to support British businesses' in this segment is 0.16 (16%), which is much lower than the baseline agreement (37%). This is highly relevant (relevance=0.98), so it receives 80% weight and overrides the baseline. The recycling attitude (0.44) is less relevant but suggests this group is more pro-social on some issues, but not specifically on supporting local businesses. Demographic notes (young families, degree) would not shift the estimate much for this specific attitude. Therefore, the distribution is shifted toward disagreement and away from agreement, with a higher proportion in 'slightly disagree' and 'strongly disagree'.
