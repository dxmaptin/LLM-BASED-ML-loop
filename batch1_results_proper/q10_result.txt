### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.71
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale correctly identifies that the available quantitative evidence (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' and 'Arrange current account | By phone') is only moderately relevant and pertains to specific behaviors rather than the core attitude concept being measured. The relevance scores for these items are below the threshold for strong override, and the qualitative note is generic, offering no additional directional evidence. The repeated application of the baseline attitude distribution is appropriate in the absence of direct, high-relevance evidence. The confidence level is appropriately described as moderate. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly relevant to the core attitude concept, and their relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative note is generic and does not provide additional directional evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained with no significant demographic or evidence-based adjustments. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of highly relevant direct evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the attitude baseline is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly about agreement with a concept, and the relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The evidence suggests low engagement in the referenced behaviors, but since the concept is attitude-based and the evidence is only moderately relevant, the baseline is maintained. No strong demographic or qualitative adjustments are warranted. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct, high-relevance evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution for attitudes is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but pertains to specific behaviors rather than general attitudes, and the relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative note is generic and does not provide additional directional evidence. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained, with moderate confidence due to the lack of direct, highly relevant evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly measure agreement with an attitude statement, and the values are low, suggesting limited behavioral engagement rather than strong attitudinal agreement or disagreement. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence is present to warrant deviation from the baseline. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct attitudinal evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the attitude baseline is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but pertains to specific behaviors rather than general attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited agreement with those specific behaviors. No strong evidence directly about the target attitude concept is present, so the baseline is maintained. Demographic or qualitative calibrations are not warranted based on the evidence provided. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct, high-relevance evidence.

### Concept: I like to look out for where my products are made or grown
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.80
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale for each run appropriately references the most relevant quantitative evidence (proportions looking out for adverts on various product types) and correctly interprets these as indicators of attentiveness to product details, which is analogous to looking out for product origin. The qualitative note about planning and weekly grocery shopping is acknowledged but not over-weighted, as it does not directly address the concept of provenance. The adjustment from the attitude baseline is methodologically sound, with agreement rates lowered and neutral/disagreement rates increased in line with the evidence. Confidence is appropriately rated as moderate-high due to the strong relevance of the quantitative data. No corrective feedback is necessary.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 7.80%
  Slightly agree: 21.60%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 31.20%
  Slightly disagree: 22.60%
  Strongly disagree: 16.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=20.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=18.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to look out for where my products are made or grown'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the proportion who 'tend to look out for adverts on' various product types, with the highest being 27% for holiday/travel products and lower for others. This suggests a minority are actively attentive to product origins or advertising. The qualitative note about planning and weekly grocery shopping suggests some conscientiousness, but not specifically about product origin. Therefore, I weighted the distribution toward slightly lower agreement than the attitude baseline, with a higher neutral and disagreement, reflecting that only a minority are attentive to product details like origin. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. Quantitative evidence shows only 27% look out for adverts on holiday/travel products (highest relevant), with lower values for other product categories (21% for healthy lifestyle, 18% for beauty, 6% for telecom). This suggests a minority are actively attentive to product origins or advertising. Qualitative note about planning in advance and weekly grocery shopping hints at some conscientiousness, but not specifically about product origin. Therefore, agreement is adjusted downward from baseline, with a higher neutral and disagreement share. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative relevance.
Run 3: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The strongest quantitative evidence is that 27% look out for adverts on holiday/travel products, 21% for healthy lifestyle, and 18% for beauty/personal grooming, with only 6% for telecom. These are all lower than the baseline for 'looking out for' product information, suggesting this segment is less likely than average to actively seek out product origin information. The qualitative note about planning and weekly shopping suggests some conscientiousness, but not specifically about product origin. Weighted toward more neutral and disagree responses, with agreement below baseline. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=22.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I like to look out for where my products are made or grown'). The strongest quantitative evidence shows that 27% of the segment tend to look out for adverts on holiday/travel products, with lower percentages for other product categories (healthy lifestyle: 21%, beauty/personal grooming: 18%, telecom: 6%). These are all below the attitude baseline agreement (37%), suggesting this segment is somewhat less likely than average to actively look out for product origins. The qualitative note about planning and weekly grocery shopping hints at some conscientiousness, but is not directly about product origin. Therefore, I weighted the agreement slightly below the attitude baseline, with a higher neutral and disagreement share. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative relevance.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=17.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The strongest quantitative evidence is that 27% of the segment tend to look out for adverts on holiday/travel products, with lower values for healthy lifestyle (21%) and beauty/personal grooming (18%), and only 6% for telecom. These are all lower than the baseline for agreement, suggesting this segment is less likely than average to actively look out for product information. The qualitative note about planning and weekly shopping suggests some conscientiousness, but not specifically about provenance. Therefore, I slightly reduce agreement and slightly increase disagreement from baseline. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence.
