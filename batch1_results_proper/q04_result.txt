### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.71
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The quantitative evidence (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related to behaviors rather than direct attitudes and has moderate relevance (highest at 0.80, just below the strong override threshold). The demographic splits are low in value and do not indicate a need for calibration. The qualitative note is generic and does not provide additional directional evidence. The rationale for maintaining the baseline attitude distribution is sound, and the confidence level is appropriately described as moderate. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the attitude baseline is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly measuring agreement with an attitude statement, and the relevance is just below the threshold for strong override (highest is 0.80). The qualitative note is generic and does not provide additional directional evidence. No demographic calibration is warranted. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is used with moderate confidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly relevant to the core attitude concept, and their relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The demographic splits (country of birth) are very low in value and do not indicate a need for calibration. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the baseline is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly about the target attitude concept, and its relevance is just below the threshold for strong override (all <0.8 except one at 0.80). The evidence suggests low engagement in the referenced behaviors, but since these are not direct attitude measures, only a minor adjustment from baseline is warranted. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence is present to justify further calibration. Thus, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.70 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related to behaviors rather than attitudes and does not directly address the target attitude concept. The evidence relevance is moderate (0.76-0.80), but the values are low and pertain to specific behaviors, so they do not warrant overriding the attitude baseline. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence is present to justify further adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct attitude evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%) is relevant but relates to behavior rather than direct attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting little deviation from baseline. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence is present to warrant adjustment. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of directly relevant high-relevance evidence.

### Concept: I consider myself an environmentalist
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.76
Critic confidence: 0.92
Critic feedback: The estimate for 'I consider myself an environmentalist' is sufficiently justified based on the provided evidence. The rationale consistently applies the identity baseline and then adjusts downward in light of strong quantitative evidence (low rates of environmental charity giving and low agreement with pro-environmental attitudes) and qualitative notes indicating weak behavioral commitment. The downward adjustment of agreement rates and increase in neutrality/disagreement is well-supported by the data. The confidence level is appropriately moderate-high, reflecting the strength of the quantitative evidence. No major gaps or misinterpretations are apparent; the evidence selection and application are balanced and methodologically sound.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 9.60%
  Slightly agree: 22.40%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.80%
  Slightly disagree: 23.40%
  Strongly disagree: 15.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=24.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The target concept is an identity statement ('I consider myself an environmentalist'), so the identity baseline applies (SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%). However, the quantitative evidence shows only 7% donate to environmental/wildlife charities, and only about 26% agree with pro-environmental attitudes. Qualitative notes indicate some care for the environment but are unwilling to pay extra for eco-friendly products, suggesting weak identification with environmentalism. Therefore, agreement rates are adjusted downward from the identity baseline, increasing neutral and disagreement responses. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. Confidence is moderate due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is an identity statement ('I consider myself an environmentalist'), so the identity baseline applies (SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%). However, the quantitative evidence shows low agreement with related environmental attitudes (around 26% agree that brands should consider environmental sustainability, and 27% agree that energy companies do not care about the environment). Charitable giving to environmental/wildlife causes is also very low (7%). Qualitative notes indicate some concern for the environment but a reluctance to pay extra for environmentally friendly products, suggesting weak identification with environmentalism. Therefore, the distribution is shifted downward from the identity baseline, with lower agreement and higher neutrality/disagreement. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target concept is an identity statement ('I consider myself an environmentalist'), so the identity baseline applies (SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%). However, the quantitative evidence shows only 7% give to environmental/wildlife charities and only about 26% agree with pro-environmental attitudes. Qualitative notes indicate care for the environment but reluctance to pay extra for eco-friendly products, suggesting weak identification. Therefore, agreement rates are adjusted downward from the identity baseline, with more respondents likely to be neutral or slightly disagree. The distribution reflects this, with agreement (SA+A) at 33% and disagreement (SD+D) at 39%. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The target concept is an identity statement ('I consider myself an environmentalist'), so the identity baseline applies (SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%). However, the quantitative evidence shows low agreement with related environmental attitudes: only 26% agree that brands should consider environmental sustainability, and only 7% support environmental/wildlife charities. Qualitative notes indicate some care for the environment but a reluctance to pay extra for environmentally friendly products. This suggests weaker identification with environmentalism than the baseline. Therefore, agreement rates are reduced and neutrality/disagreement increased. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Confidence is moderate due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=24.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The target is an identity statement ('I consider myself an environmentalist'), so the identity baseline applies: SA 22%, A 35%, N 18%, D 15%, SD 10%. However, the quantitative evidence shows low agreement with related environmental attitudes (values around 0.26-0.27) and very low engagement with environmental/wildlife charities (0.07). Qualitative notes indicate some concern for the environment but a reluctance to take action or pay extra. This suggests that while some in the segment may care about the environment, few strongly identify as environmentalists. Therefore, I shift the distribution downward from the identity baseline: lower 'agree' and 'strongly agree', higher 'disagree' and 'strongly disagree', and keep 'neither' relatively high. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative relevance.
