### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.71
Critic confidence: 0.80
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale for each run correctly identifies that the quantitative evidence (e.g., low rates for 'Manage current account by phone' and 'Arrange current account by phone') is only tangentially related to the attitude concept being measured and does not directly inform the distribution of agreement with the unspecified 'Concept.' The demographic indicators (country of birth) are also low in value and do not warrant adjustment from the baseline. The qualitative note is not informative. Therefore, maintaining the baseline attitude distribution is methodologically sound, and the confidence level is appropriately set as moderate due to the lack of direct evidence. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is used (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., low rates for 'Manage current account by phone' and 'Arrange current account by phone') is relevant but does not directly measure attitudes toward the unspecified 'Concept,' and the values are low (mostly under 12%). The qualitative note is not informative. No strong demographic or evidence-based reason to shift from baseline. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the attitude baseline is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but not directly about agreement with an attitude statement, and its relevance is just below the threshold for strong override. The demographic indicators (country of birth: Rest of Europe/Other) are low in value and do not suggest a major shift from baseline. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly about the target attitude concept, and the relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative note is generic and does not provide additional directional evidence. No demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained, with moderate confidence due to the lack of strong, directly relevant evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution for attitudes is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but pertains to specific behaviors rather than general attitudes, and their values are low, suggesting limited agreement with the specific behaviors referenced. No strong evidence directly overrides the attitude baseline. Demographic calibrations are not indicated as necessary based on the evidence. Therefore, the baseline is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the attitude baseline is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but relates to behaviors rather than direct attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited agreement with the specific behaviors referenced. The country of birth breakdowns are also low in value and do not directly inform the attitude in question. No strong evidence to override the baseline, so the default attitude distribution is maintained. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct, high-relevance evidence.

### Concept: I only buy products from companies that have ethics and values that I agree with
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.87
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently prioritizes the most relevant quantitative evidence ('If a brand I like expresses a view I agree with in advertisements, I am more likely to buy it from that brand', value=0.06, relevance=0.98), which is directly related to the target concept and indicates very low agreement. The qualitative evidence further supports the interpretation that ethical alignment is not a strong driver for this segment. The baseline attitude distribution is appropriately adjusted downward, with clear justification for increasing disagreement and reducing agreement. The repeated runs show consistent logic and weighting of evidence, and the confidence is appropriately high given the strength and relevance of the evidence. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 4.00%
  Slightly agree: 13.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 30.00%
  Strongly disagree: 25.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.85 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'If a brand I like expresses a view I agree with in advertisements, I am more likely to buy it from that brand' (value=0.06, relevance=0.98), which is very low and directly related, indicating weak agreement with values-based purchasing. Qualitative evidence ('Care about the environment but won't pay extra to buy environmentally friendly products') further supports that ethical alignment is not a strong driver for this segment. Other behavioral evidence (online purchases, ad attention) is less relevant. Therefore, the distribution is shifted toward disagreement compared to the attitude baseline, with a higher proportion in 'slightly disagree' and 'strongly disagree'.
Run 2: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The most relevant quantitative evidence (relevance 0.98) shows only 6% agree that they are more likely to buy from a brand if it expresses a view they agree with, which is much lower than baseline agreement. This suggests agreement with the stricter statement ('I only buy...') will be even lower. Qualitative evidence also suggests values matter but not enough to drive exclusive purchasing. Therefore, agreement is reduced well below baseline, with most respondents disagreeing or remaining neutral. Distribution is weighted by the direct quantitative evidence (80% weight), with minor qualitative support. Confidence is high due to strong, highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement. The most relevant quantitative evidence is 'If a brand I like expresses a view I agree with in advertisements, I am more likely to buy it from that brand' with a very low agreement value (0.06), indicating very few in this segment are influenced by brand values in their purchasing. Qualitative notes reinforce this: the segment cares about issues like the environment but is unwilling to pay extra for ethical choices, suggesting low behavioral follow-through on ethical attitudes. Baseline for attitudes is adjusted downward due to strong, highly relevant evidence of low agreement. Neutral and disagreement responses are increased accordingly.
Run 4: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the attitude item: 'If a brand I like expresses a view I agree with in advertisements, I am more likely to buy it from that brand' (value=0.06, relevance=0.98), indicating very low agreement with values-based purchasing even in a less strict context. The qualitative note ('Care about the environment but won't pay extra to buy environmentally friendly products') reinforces that this segment cares about values but does not act on them in purchasing. Other behavioral evidence (online purchases, ad attention) is less directly relevant. Given the strong direct evidence and qualitative support, agreement is much lower than the attitude baseline, with a majority disagreeing and a small minority agreeing.
Run 5: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.87 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement. The most relevant quantitative evidence is the attitude item: 'If a brand I like expresses a view I agree with in advertisements, I am more likely to buy it from that brand' (value=0.06, relevance=0.98), which is much lower than the baseline for agreement. This suggests very low agreement with the target concept in this segment. Qualitative evidence ('Care about the environment but won't pay extra to buy environmentally friendly products') also supports the idea that values are not a strong driver of purchase behavior for this group. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is shifted strongly toward disagreement, with a higher proportion in 'slightly disagree' and 'strongly disagree', and agreement categories reduced accordingly. Confidence is high due to strong, highly relevant quantitative evidence.
