### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.70
Critic confidence: 0.80
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The topline quantitative data (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%, and low demographic splits) are relevant but do not directly measure attitudes toward the concept in question. The rationale correctly identifies that these behavioral and demographic indicators are not strong enough to override the default attitude baseline. The qualitative notes are generic and do not provide additional direction. The repeated application of the baseline attitude distribution is appropriate, and the confidence level is accurately described as moderate due to the lack of direct, high-relevance evidence. No revision is required.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the attitude baseline is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly indicate strong agreement or disagreement with a general attitude concept, and the values are low. The demographic splits (country of birth) are also low in value and do not suggest a need for significant calibration. No strong evidence to override the baseline, so the default attitude distribution is maintained. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct, high-relevance evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%) is only weakly related to general attitudes and does not directly measure agreement with the target concept. The evidence is not strong or highly relevant to override the baseline. Demographic calibrations are not indicated by the evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained, with moderate confidence due to the lack of direct evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution for attitudes is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly measure agreement with an attitude statement, and the values are low, suggesting limited behavioral endorsement. There is no strong evidence to override the baseline. Demographic calibrations are not indicated by the evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline attitude distribution is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly measure agreement with an attitude statement, and the relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative note is generic and does not provide additional directional evidence. Therefore, the baseline is maintained with no significant demographic or evidence-based adjustments. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct, high-relevance evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the attitude baseline is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly measure agreement with an attitude statement; rather, it reflects behaviors or demographics. The evidence is not strong or directly relevant enough to override the baseline. Demographic calibrations are not indicated as necessary based on the evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is applied with moderate confidence.

### Concept: I do not care what my carbon footprint is
Iterations: 2
Estimator average confidence: 0.81
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently and appropriately links the low agreement (6%) with 'I do not mind paying more for organic food' to a higher likelihood of indifference or agreement with 'I do not care what my carbon footprint is.' The repeated use of the attitude baseline and the clear explanation for shifting the distribution toward more agreement and neutrality are methodologically sound. The qualitative evidence is correctly assessed as weakly relevant and does not unduly influence the estimate. The logic is transparent, and the evidence selection is appropriate. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 14.20%
  Slightly agree: 26.80%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 32.40%
  Slightly disagree: 16.20%
  Strongly disagree: 10.40%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=23.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=34.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The key quantitative evidence is very low agreement (6%) with 'I do not mind paying more for organic food,' which indicates low willingness to take pro-environmental action. This suggests that indifference or neutrality toward environmental issues like carbon footprint is likely higher than baseline. Therefore, I increased 'agree' and 'neutral' responses, and decreased 'disagree' responses. The qualitative evidence about planning/shopping is weakly relevant and does not strongly affect the estimate. The distribution reflects a higher proportion of indifference or lack of concern about carbon footprint, consistent with the low pro-environmental action shown in the evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=14.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=16.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I do not care what my carbon footprint is'). The key quantitative evidence is that only 6% agree with 'I do not mind paying more for organic food', indicating very low willingness to take pro-environmental action. This suggests a higher proportion of the segment is indifferent or unconcerned about environmental impact, so agreement and neutrality should be higher than the attitude baseline. The qualitative evidence about planning and shopping is weakly relevant and does not indicate strong environmental concern. Therefore, I increased agreement and neutrality, and decreased disagreement relative to the baseline. This logic is consistent: low pro-environmental action correlates with higher indifference or agreement with not caring about carbon footprint.
Run 3: Strongly agree=18.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=13.00%, Strongly disagree=9.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I do not care what my carbon footprint is'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the very low agreement (6%) with 'I do not mind paying more for organic food', which indicates low pro-environmental action and likely correlates with higher indifference or neutrality toward environmental impact. This suggests that more people are indifferent or unconcerned about their carbon footprint, so agreement and neutrality should be higher than the attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The qualitative evidence about planning and shopping is weakly relevant and does not strongly affect environmental attitudes. Therefore, I increase both agreement and neutrality, and decrease disagreement, reflecting a population that is more indifferent or unconcerned about their carbon footprint. Confidence is high due to strong, directly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=11.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude statement ('I do not care what my carbon footprint is'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the very low agreement (6%) with 'I do not mind paying more for organic food', which indicates low willingness to take pro-environmental action. This suggests that indifference or neutrality toward environmental issues is likely higher in this segment. Therefore, compared to the attitude baseline (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%), I shift the distribution toward more agreement and neutrality, reducing disagreement. The qualitative evidence about planning/shopping is weakly relevant and does not significantly affect the estimate. The final distribution reflects a higher proportion of neutrality and agreement, consistent with the low pro-environmental action shown in the evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=17.00%, Strongly disagree=10.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude ('I do not care what my carbon footprint is'). The most relevant quantitative evidence is the very low agreement (6%) with 'I do not mind paying more for organic food,' which indicates low willingness to take pro-environmental action. This suggests a higher proportion of indifference or agreement with not caring about carbon footprint, compared to the baseline. The qualitative evidence about planning and shopping is only weakly relevant and does not indicate strong pro-environmental attitudes. Therefore, I shift the distribution toward more agreement and neutrality, reducing disagreement below the attitude baseline. This is consistent with the evidence showing low pro-environmental action, which likely correlates with greater indifference or agreement with not caring about carbon footprint.
