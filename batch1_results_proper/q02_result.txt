### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.71
Critic confidence: 0.80
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale consistently notes that the available quantitative evidence (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) pertains to behaviors rather than direct attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited engagement with the referenced behaviors. The country of birth breakdowns are also low and not directly relevant to the attitude concept. No strong evidence exists to override the baseline attitude distribution, and the qualitative notes do not provide additional direction. Therefore, maintaining the baseline attitude distribution is appropriate, and the confidence level is moderate due to the lack of highly relevant, direct evidence. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the attitude baseline is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but relates to behaviors rather than direct attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited agreement with the specific behaviors referenced. The country of birth breakdowns are also low in value and do not directly inform the attitude concept. No strong evidence exists to override the baseline, so the default attitude distribution is maintained. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of directly relevant, high-relevance quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item type is classified as 'attitude,' so the baseline distribution is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but pertains to behaviors rather than direct attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited agreement with the specific behaviors referenced. No strong evidence directly overrides the attitude baseline. Demographic calibrations are not indicated as necessary based on the evidence. Therefore, the baseline is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly about agreement with an attitude statement, and the relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative notes do not provide additional directional evidence. Therefore, the baseline for attitude is maintained, with no significant demographic or evidence-based adjustments. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of highly relevant direct evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline attitude distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly measure agreement with an attitude statement, and the values are low, suggesting little behavioral engagement but not directly shifting attitudes. Demographic calibrations are not strongly indicated by the evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly about the target attitude concept, and the relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative note is generic and does not provide additional directional evidence. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained with moderate confidence.

### Concept: Climate change is the biggest threat to civilisation
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.67
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The rationale consistently acknowledges that there is no direct quantitative evidence about climate change attitudes in the provided data, and only modestly adjusts the baseline based on indirect demographic hints (couples, young families, degree holders, urban/aspirational profile). The adjustments are small and well-explained, reflecting the limited strength of the evidence. The confidence is appropriately described as moderate. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 12.00%
  Slightly agree: 28.40%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 18.60%
  Strongly disagree: 13.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=28.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=19.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. Demographic hints (couples, young families, degree holders) suggest a slightly more progressive and educated segment, which may be marginally more likely to agree with climate change concern. However, no direct evidence about climate attitudes is present. Quantitative evidence is unrelated to climate attitudes, so baseline is only slightly adjusted (+2pp to agreement). Final distribution is close to baseline, with a small upward calibration for agreement. Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.62 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so the baseline is applied: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The quantitative evidence provided relates to consumer behaviors (online purchases, places visited) and gentrification, but none directly address attitudes toward climate change. The qualitative note suggests the segment is more likely to be couples and young families with degrees, which may slightly increase agreement with progressive attitudes like concern for climate change, but the effect is small (urban/educated/younger demographics typically show slightly higher concern). However, due to lack of direct evidence, the baseline is maintained with no more than a +1pp adjustment, which is within rounding error. Confidence is moderate due to indirect demographic hints but no direct attitude data.
Run 3: Strongly agree=12.00%, Slightly agree=29.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=13.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: The item is an attitude statement, so the baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The segment is described as couples and young families with degrees, which may slightly increase agreement with progressive attitudes like concern about climate change (+1pp to agreement). No direct evidence on climate attitudes is provided, but the demographic profile (younger, educated) is associated with somewhat higher concern about climate change. No strong quantitative override is present, so the baseline is only modestly adjusted. Final distribution reflects a slight increase in agreement and a corresponding decrease in disagreement, maintaining variance and neutrality where evidence is limited.
Run 4: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=29.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. Demographic hints (couples, young families, degree holders) suggest a slightly more progressive and educated segment, which may be more likely to agree with strong climate change statements. However, no direct quantitative evidence about climate attitudes is provided. The segment's online shopping and urban gentrification context suggest moderate affluence and urbanity, which can slightly increase agreement. Adjusted agreement up by 2pp (SA +3, A +2, D -2, SD -3). Confidence is moderate due to lack of direct evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=13.00%, Slightly agree=29.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=18.00%, Strongly disagree=12.00%
  Conf=0.68 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. Demographic hints (couples, young families, degree holders, urban/aspirational profile) suggest a slight tilt toward progressive attitudes, so +1pp to agreement. No direct evidence on climate attitudes, but the segment skews younger and more educated, which correlates with higher climate concern. However, the lack of direct quantitative evidence means only a modest adjustment from baseline. Final distribution reflects a slightly higher agreement than baseline, but not dramatically so.
