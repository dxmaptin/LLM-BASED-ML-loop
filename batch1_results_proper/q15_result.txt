### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.72
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The quantitative evidence relates to specific behaviors (e.g., managing or arranging a current account by phone), but these are not direct measures of the target attitude concept. The relevance scores for the quantitative evidence are at or just below the threshold for strong influence, and the actual values are low, indicating limited prevalence of the behaviors. The qualitative notes do not provide direct evidence about the attitude in question. Therefore, maintaining the baseline attitude distribution is appropriate, and the rationale for not adjusting the baseline is clearly articulated in each run. Confidence is moderate to high due to the systematic application of the baseline in the absence of strong, directly relevant evidence.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution for attitudes is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but not directly about agreement with an attitude statement, and the highest relevance is 0.80, just at the threshold for strong evidence. However, the values are low and pertain to behaviors, not attitudes, so they do not strongly override the baseline. No demographic calibration is indicated. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained, with moderate confidence due to the lack of directly relevant attitude evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%) is related but not directly about the target attitude concept, and its relevance is just below the threshold for strong override (max 0.80). The values are low, suggesting limited agreement with the specific behaviors referenced, but since these are not direct attitude measures, the baseline is maintained. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence justifies deviation. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct, highly relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution for attitudes is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly indicate strong agreement or disagreement with a general attitude concept. The evidence values are low and do not strongly shift the baseline. Demographic calibrations are not clearly indicated as necessary from the evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained, with moderate confidence due to the lack of highly relevant direct evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is used (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but pertains to behaviors rather than direct attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited agreement with related behaviors. However, since these are not direct attitude measures and their relevance is just below the strong threshold, they are weighted at 50% or less and do not justify overriding the baseline. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence is present to warrant further adjustment. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct attitude data.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is used. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but pertains to specific behaviors rather than general attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited agreement with those specific behaviors. No strong evidence directly overrides the attitude baseline. Demographic calibrations are not indicated by the evidence. Therefore, the baseline for attitudes is maintained, with moderate confidence due to the lack of strong, directly relevant evidence.

### Concept: Important when buying a car: environmentally friendly / low co2 emissions
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.76
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The rationale consistently references the most relevant qualitative evidence ('Care about the environment but won't pay extra to buy environmentally friendly products', relevance=0.98), which directly addresses the concept being measured (importance of environmental friendliness when buying a car). The adjustment from the baseline is logical: agreement is reduced and neutrality/disagreement increased, reflecting the segment's reluctance to prioritize environmental factors in purchasing decisions. Demographic and quantitative evidence are considered but appropriately judged as not requiring further adjustment. The repeated, consistent application of this logic across runs, with only minor variation, demonstrates a robust and transparent approach. No major gaps or misinterpretations are evident. Confidence is high due to the directness and relevance of the qualitative evidence.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 7.20%
  Slightly agree: 22.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 32.00%
  Slightly disagree: 23.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude (importance of environmental friendliness when buying a car). The qualitative evidence is highly relevant and states that this segment cares about the environment but is not willing to pay extra for environmentally friendly products, suggesting a lower level of agreement than the baseline. The baseline for attitudes is: SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. I shifted the distribution slightly toward disagreement and neutrality, reducing agreement and increasing neutral/disagree, to reflect the segment's reluctance to prioritize environmental friendliness in purchasing decisions. Demographic evidence (lower managerial/professional, moderate education) does not strongly shift this further. Confidence is moderate-high due to the strong qualitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude (importance of environmental friendliness when buying a car). The qualitative evidence is highly relevant and states that while this segment cares about the environment, they are not willing to pay extra for environmentally friendly products. This suggests lower agreement than the attitude baseline (37% agreement), with a likely shift toward neutrality and slight disagreement. The segment's occupational and educational profile (lower managerial, some higher education) does not strongly indicate higher environmental prioritization. Therefore, agreement is reduced, neutrality and slight disagreement are increased, and strong disagreement is slightly above baseline. Confidence is moderate-high due to the directness of the qualitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude (importance of environmental friendliness when buying a car). Baseline for attitudes is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The strongest evidence is the qualitative note: 'Care about the environment but won't pay extra to buy environmentally friendly products' (relevance 0.98), indicating that while environmental concern exists, it does not translate into strong prioritization when it involves personal cost or tradeoff. This suggests a shift from agreement toward neutrality and slight disagreement. Demographic evidence (lower managerial/professional occupations, moderate education) does not strongly shift the baseline. Therefore, agreement is reduced, neutrality and slight disagreement are increased. Confidence is moderate due to strong qualitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=8.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude (importance of environmental friendliness when buying a car). Baseline for attitudes is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The strongest evidence is the qualitative note: 'Care about the environment but won't pay extra to buy environmentally friendly products' (relevance 0.98), which suggests that while environmental concern exists, it does not translate into strong prioritization when making purchase decisions. This justifies lowering agreement and increasing neutrality/disagreement. Demographic evidence (lower managerial/professional occupations, moderate education) does not strongly shift the baseline. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong qualitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=22.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=32.00%, Slightly disagree=23.00%, Strongly disagree=16.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: The concept is an attitude (importance of environmental friendliness when buying a car). Baseline for attitudes is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The qualitative evidence ('Care about the environment but won't pay extra to buy environmentally friendly products') is highly relevant (relevance=0.98) and suggests that while environmental concern exists, it does not strongly translate into prioritizing low CO2 emissions when making a purchase. This justifies shifting some agreement into neutral and disagreement, reducing both 'strongly agree' and 'slightly agree', and increasing 'neither' and 'slightly disagree'. Demographic evidence (moderate lower managerial/professional occupations, low higher education) does not warrant further adjustment. Confidence is moderately high due to strong qualitative evidence.
