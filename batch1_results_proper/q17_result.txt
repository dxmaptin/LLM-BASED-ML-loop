### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.70
Critic confidence: 0.80
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale for each run correctly identifies that the available quantitative evidence (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is only tangentially relevant to the attitude concept and does not directly measure agreement with the attitude statement. The demographic evidence (country of birth) shows very low proportions and does not warrant calibration. The qualitative note is generic and does not provide strong directional evidence. Therefore, applying the baseline attitude distribution is appropriate, and the confidence level is correctly described as moderate. No revision is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.65 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly reflect agreement with an attitude statement, and the values are low, suggesting little deviation from baseline. Demographic calibrations are not indicated by the evidence. No strong evidence to override the baseline, so the default attitude distribution is used. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct, high-relevance quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item type is classified as 'attitude,' so the baseline distribution is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but pertains to specific behaviors rather than general attitudes, and their values are low, suggesting little deviation from the baseline. The qualitative note is generic and does not provide strong directional evidence. No demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of strong, directly relevant evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item type is classified as 'attitude', so the baseline attitude distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but pertains to specific behaviors rather than direct attitudes, and the relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The demographic evidence (country of birth) shows very low proportions for 'Rest of Europe' and 'Other', which does not warrant a demographic calibration. No strong qualitative evidence is present. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly measure agreement with an attitude statement, and the values are low, suggesting limited behavioral endorsement. The qualitative note is generic and does not provide strong directional evidence. No demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.70 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is used (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided is relevant but does not directly address the target concept, with the highest relevance at 0.80 and low values (e.g., 0.0164, 0.1120). These suggest low engagement or agreement with related behaviors, but since they are not direct measures of the attitude in question, only a minor weighting is applied. No strong demographic calibration is warranted. Therefore, the baseline is maintained with moderate confidence.

### Concept: Gambling (offline)
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.79
Critic confidence: 0.90
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the available evidence. The main quantitative evidence is that 17.5% report online gambling/betting weekly, which is a behavior and likely higher than offline gambling rates. The rationale for shifting the attitude distribution toward more disagreement (and less agreement) is sound, as offline gambling is typically less frequent and less socially accepted than online gambling, especially in the absence of qualitative evidence suggesting higher acceptance. The repeated reference to the baseline for attitudes and the consistent adjustment based on the quantitative evidence demonstrates a methodologically grounded approach. The confidence is appropriately described as moderate-high, given the indirect nature of the evidence (online behavior as a proxy for offline attitudes). No further revision is needed unless new, more directly relevant evidence becomes available.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 6.00%
  Slightly agree: 14.60%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.20%
  Slightly disagree: 28.40%
  Strongly disagree: 22.80%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=17.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=21.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, the quantitative evidence shows only 17% report online gambling/betting weekly, which is a behavior and likely higher than offline gambling rates. This suggests low agreement with positive attitudes toward gambling (offline). Therefore, I shift the distribution toward more disagreement: reduce agreement (SA/A) and increase disagreement (D/SD), keeping neutral stable. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=5.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=27.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude (about offline gambling). Baseline for attitude is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, direct quantitative evidence shows only 17% report online gambling/betting weekly, which is a behavior and likely higher than offline rates. This suggests negative attitudes toward gambling are more prevalent in this segment. Adjusted downward agreement and increased disagreement accordingly. No strong demographic calibration needed. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=28.00%, Strongly disagree=22.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The only strong quantitative evidence is that 17% report online gambling/betting weekly, which is a behavior and likely higher than offline rates. Offline gambling is typically less frequent than online, so agreement with positive attitudes toward offline gambling is likely lower. Therefore, I shift the distribution toward more disagreement, reducing agreement and increasing disagreement by about 5pp each. No strong demographic calibration is indicated. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong behavioral evidence for online gambling, but only indirect relevance for offline attitudes.
Run 4: Strongly agree=7.00%, Slightly agree=15.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=30.00%, Slightly disagree=27.00%, Strongly disagree=21.00%
  Conf=0.78 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude, so baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. The only strong evidence is quantitative: 17.5% report online gambling/betting weekly, which is a behavior and likely higher than offline gambling due to ease of access. Offline gambling is typically less frequent, so agreement with a positive attitude toward offline gambling should be lower than the online behavior rate. Therefore, I reduce agreement (SA+A) below the baseline, increase disagreement, and slightly increase neutrality to reflect uncertainty and likely lower engagement. No demographic calibration is indicated. Confidence is moderate-high due to strong quantitative evidence for a related behavior.
Run 5: Strongly agree=4.00%, Slightly agree=13.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=30.00%, Strongly disagree=25.00%
  Conf=0.82 / Rationale: The concept type is attitude, so the baseline is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, the only strong quantitative evidence is that 17% report online gambling/betting weekly (relevance 0.98), which is a behavior and likely higher than offline gambling rates. Offline gambling is generally less frequent than online, so agreement with a positive attitude toward offline gambling is likely lower. No qualitative evidence is provided to suggest higher acceptance. Therefore, I shift the distribution toward more disagreement, with a higher proportion in 'slightly disagree' and 'strongly disagree', and lower agreement than baseline. Confidence is high due to strong quantitative evidence, but not maximal since the evidence is for online, not offline gambling.
