### Concept: Concept
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.72
Critic confidence: 0.85
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified given the evidence provided. The rationale for maintaining the baseline attitude distribution is sound: the quantitative evidence, while somewhat relevant, does not directly measure the target attitude and has relevance scores below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative evidence is minimal and not concept-specific, and there is no demographic evidence warranting adjustment. The repeated application of the baseline with moderate confidence is appropriate in the absence of stronger, directly relevant evidence. No corrective action is needed.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 10.00%
  Slightly agree: 27.00%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 28.00%
  Slightly disagree: 20.00%
  Strongly disagree: 15.00%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%) is related but not directly about the target attitude concept, and its relevance is just below the threshold for strong override (max 0.80). The other values are quite low (2-4%), indicating low engagement or agreement with the related behaviors, but since these are not direct attitude measures, only a minor adjustment is warranted. No strong demographic or qualitative evidence is present to justify deviation from the baseline. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct, highly relevant evidence.
Run 2: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but does not directly measure agreement with an attitude statement, and the relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative evidence is minimal and not concept-specific. No demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained with moderate confidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution for attitudes is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly about the target attitude concept, and their relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative note is generic and does not provide additional directional evidence. No demographic calibration is warranted based on the evidence. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained, with moderate confidence due to the lack of strong, directly relevant evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is used (SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%). The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is relevant but pertains to behaviors rather than direct attitudes, and the values are low, suggesting limited agreement with the specific behaviors referenced. There is no strong direct evidence to override the baseline, and demographic or qualitative notes do not indicate a need for calibration. Therefore, the baseline attitude distribution is maintained. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct, highly relevant evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=10.00%, Slightly agree=27.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=28.00%, Slightly disagree=20.00%, Strongly disagree=15.00%
  Conf=0.72 / Rationale: The item is classified as an attitude, so the baseline distribution is applied. The quantitative evidence provided (e.g., 'Manage current account | By phone' at 11%, 'Arrange current account | By phone' at 2.6%) is related but not directly measuring agreement with an attitude statement, and the relevance scores are just below the threshold for strong override. The qualitative notes are minimal and do not provide strong directional evidence. Therefore, the baseline for attitudes is maintained with no significant demographic or evidence-based adjustments. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of direct, high-relevance evidence.

### Concept: Organic Foods
Iterations: 1
Estimator average confidence: 0.89
Critic confidence: 0.95
Critic feedback: The estimate is sufficiently justified. The runs consistently and appropriately prioritize the highly relevant quantitative topline (6% agreement) over the generic attitude baseline, as required by the evidence hierarchy. The distribution is correctly shifted toward disagreement, with only minor variation in the neutral category, and the rationale for each run is clear and methodologically sound. The secondary evidence (adverts on packaged foods) is correctly treated as less relevant, and the qualitative context is acknowledged as minimal. No demographic calibration is needed. The evidence selection and weighting are appropriate, and the final distributions are well-supported by the provided data.
Final distribution:
  Strongly agree: 2.20%
  Slightly agree: 6.20%
  Neither agree nor disagree: 21.60%
  Slightly disagree: 33.40%
  Strongly disagree: 36.60%
Runs:
Run 1: Strongly agree=2.00%, Slightly agree=6.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=32.00%, Strongly disagree=40.00%
  Conf=0.92 / Rationale: The item is an attitude statement about willingness to pay more for organic food. The direct quantitative evidence (value=0.06, relevance=0.98) shows only 6% agreement, which is far below the attitude baseline (37% agreement). According to the evidence hierarchy, this strong, highly relevant quantitative evidence should override the baseline. The second data point about looking out for adverts on packaged foods (11%) is less directly relevant but supports low engagement with food-related premium behaviors. No demographic calibration is needed. The final distribution is heavily weighted toward disagreement, closely matching the quantitative topline, with a small allowance for neutral responses.
Run 2: Strongly agree=3.00%, Slightly agree=7.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=20.00%, Slightly disagree=33.00%, Strongly disagree=37.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude ("I do not mind paying more for organic food"). Baseline for attitude is 10/27/28/20/15, but direct quantitative evidence (relevance 0.98) shows only ~6% agreement (value=0.0598), which is much lower than baseline. This evidence is highly relevant and should override the baseline, shifting the distribution heavily toward disagreement. The second item (adverts on packaged foods) is less relevant but suggests some engagement with food choices, though not specifically organic. No major demographic calibration is indicated. Final distribution is weighted toward 'slightly disagree' and 'strongly disagree' to reflect the low agreement in the segment. Confidence is high due to strong direct evidence.
Run 3: Strongly agree=2.00%, Slightly agree=7.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=23.00%, Slightly disagree=33.00%, Strongly disagree=35.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude ("I do not mind paying more for organic food"). Baseline for attitudes is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, direct quantitative evidence (relevance 0.98) shows only 6% agreement (value=0.0598), which is much lower than baseline. This strong evidence (weight 80%) overrides the baseline, shifting the distribution heavily toward disagreement. The qualitative context is minimal and does not contradict the quantitative topline. No major demographic calibration is indicated. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 4: Strongly agree=2.00%, Slightly agree=7.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=23.00%, Slightly disagree=33.00%, Strongly disagree=35.00%
  Conf=0.88 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude ("I do not mind paying more for organic food"). Baseline for attitudes is SA 10%, A 27%, N 28%, D 20%, SD 15%. However, direct quantitative evidence shows only 6% agreement (value=0.0598) in this segment, which is much lower than baseline. This strong evidence (relevance 0.98) overrides the baseline, so agreement is set very low. Disagreement is increased accordingly, with neutral held near baseline. No significant demographic calibration is indicated. Confidence is high due to strong, relevant quantitative evidence.
Run 5: Strongly agree=2.00%, Slightly agree=4.00%, Neither agree nor disagree=22.00%, Slightly disagree=36.00%, Strongly disagree=36.00%
  Conf=0.90 / Rationale: Concept type is attitude ("I do not mind paying more for organic food"). The direct quantitative evidence shows only 6% agreement (value=0.0598, relevance=0.98), which is far below the baseline for attitudes (37% agreement). This strong evidence should override the baseline, so agreement is set very low (SA 2%, A 4%). The remainder is distributed between neutral and disagreement, with a heavier weight on disagreement to reflect the low agreement rate. No significant demographic calibration is indicated. Confidence is high due to strong, highly relevant quantitative evidence.
